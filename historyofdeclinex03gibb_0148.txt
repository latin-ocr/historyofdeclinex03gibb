THE DECLINE AND FALL'

The captives, and the spoils, of Africa, were laid at the feet of the
emperor; but Stilicho, whose moderationi appeared more conspi-
cuous, and more sincere, in the midst of prosperity, still affected to
consult the laws of the republic3 and referred to¹ the senate and
people of Rome, the judgment of the most illustrious criminals ⁵⁴.
Their trial was public and solemn3 but the judges, in the exercise of
this· obsolete and precarious jurisditffion, were i-mpatient to punish¹
the African magistrates, who hadjntercepted the subsistence of the
Roman people· The rich, and. guilty province was oppreffed by the
Imperial minist—ers, who had, a vifible interest to multiply the number
of the accomplices of Gildo ; and if an edict of Honorius seems to
check the malicious industry of informers, a subsequent ediec, at the
distance of ten years, continues and rencvvs the prosecution of tho
offences which had been committed in the time of the general re-
bellion⁵³. The adherents of the tyrant who escaped the first fury
of the soldiers, and the judges, might desiste some consolation from,
the tragic fate of his brother, who couldnever obtain his pardon fort-
the extraordinary services which he had performedz After he hadr
finissied an important war in the space of a single winter, Mascezel„
was received at the court of Milan with Ioud applause‚ affeCkedgra*
