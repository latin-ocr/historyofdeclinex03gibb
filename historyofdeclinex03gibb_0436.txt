THE DECLrNE AND FALL

C H A P. suing spring, he repeated his demand, of the princess Houoria, and

eluded3 and the indignant lover immediately took the field, paffed
the Alps, invaded Italy, and besieged Aquileia with an innumerable
host of Bau-basians. Those Barbarians were unsszilled in the methods-
of condufflng a regular siege, which, even among the ancients, re-
quired some knowledge, or at least some praefice, of the mechanic
arts. But the labour of many thousand provincials and captives,
whose lives were sacrificed without pity, might execute the most
painfnl and dangerous work. The ss<ill of the Roman artists might
be corrupted to the destruction of their country. The walls of Aqui-
leia were affaulted by a formidable train of battering rams, move-
able turrets, and engines, that threw stones, darts, and fire ⁴⁸3 and
the monarch of the Huns employed the forcible impulse of hope,
sear, emulation, and interest, to subvert the only barrier which de-
layed the conquest of* Italy. Aquileia was at that period one of the
richest, the most populous, and the strongest of the maritime cities
of the Hadriatic coast. The Gothic auxiliaries, who appear to have
served under their native princes Alaric and Antala, communi-
cated their intrepid spirit; and the citizens still remembered the
glorious and successful resistance, which their ancestors had opposed
to a fierce, inexorable Barbarian, who disgraced the majesty of the
Roman purple. Three months were consumed without effe& in the
siege of Aquileia3 till the want of provisions, and the clamours of ’
his army, compelled Attila to relinquish the enterprise; andre-
