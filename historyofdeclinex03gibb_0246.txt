THE DECLINE AND FALL

thousand Huns, who arrived on theconfines of Italy, attended by
such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep
and oxen, as might have been sufficient, not only for the march of
an army, but for the settlement of a colony. But the court and·
councils of Honorius still remained a scene of weakness and distrac-
tion‚ of corruption and anarchy. Instigated by the praefect Jovius,
the guards rose in furious mutiny, and demanded the heads of two
generals, and of the two principal eun-uchs. The generals, under
a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on ssiip-board, and pri-
vately executed3 while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a
mild and secure exile at Milan and Constantinople. Eusebius the
eunuch, and the Barbarian Allobich‚ succeeded to the command of
the bed-chamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of
these subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruition.
By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great cham-
berlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks, before the eyes
of the astonished emperor3 and the subsequent affaffination of Allo-
bich, in the midst of a public proceffion‚ is the only circumstance of
his life, in which Honorius discovered the faintest symptom of
courage or resentment. Yet before they fell, Eusebius and Allo-
bich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire, by op-
posmg the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius‚ from a selfish, and
perhaps a criminal, motive, had negociated with Alaric, in a pere„-
sonal interview under the walls of Rimini. During the absence of
Jovius, the emperor was persuaded to affume a lofty tone of infleijle
dignity, such as neither his situation, nor his character, could enable
him to support: and a letter, figned with the name of Honorius, was
immediately dispatched to the Praetorian praefedt, granting him a free
permiffion to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to

prostitute' the military honours of Rome to the proud demands of a
Barbarian. This letter was imprudently communicated to Alaiic

himself 3
