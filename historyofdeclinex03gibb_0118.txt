THE DECLINE AND FALL

s--w-—a that the saints, who reigned with Christ, cast an eye of pity upon

earth3 that they were warmly interested in the prosperity of the
Catholic church; and that the individuals‚ who imitated the example
of their faith and piety, were the peculiar and favourite objectS of
their most tender regard. Sometimes, indeed, their friendssiip might
be influenced by considerations of a less exalted kind: they viewed,

authority, which the saints enjoyed in the presence· of the Supreme
God3 and it seemed almost superfluous to enquire‚ whether they
were continually obliged to intercede before thevthrone of‘grace 3 or
