overwhelmed their adversaries, who had retreated to the church or
conventicle of the Arians. Gainas was either innocent of the defigi),
or too confident of his success: he was astonished by the intelli-
gence, that the flower of his army had been inglorioussy destroyed;
that he himself was declared a public enemy3 and that his country-
man, Fravitta, a brave and loyal confederate, had ass'umed the ma-

that grew on the margin of the fortification83 and Gainas, who vainly
regretted the wealth and luxury of Afia, embraced a desperate reso-
lution of forcing the pafl‘age of the Hellespont. He was destitute
of veffels; but the woods of the Chersonesus afforded materials for
rasts, and his intrepid Barbarians did not refuse to trust themselves to

and with irresistible weight<3 and the Hellespont was covered with
the fragments of the Gothic shipwreck. After the destruction of his
hopes, and the loss of many thousands of his bravest soldiers, Gainas,
who could no longer aspire to govern, or to subdue, the Romans,
determined to resume the independence of a savage life. A light
and active body of Barbarian horse, disengaged from their infantry
