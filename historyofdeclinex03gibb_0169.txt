a Pagan, who had served, however, with distinguiihed reputation
among the veteran generals of Theodosius. The camp of the Goffls,
which Alaric had pitched in the neighbourhood of Pollentia& was
thrown into confusion by the sudden and impetuous charge of the
Imperial cavalry ; but, in a few momente, the undaunted genius of
their leader gave them an order, and a field, of battle3 and, as soon

Alani, whose diminutive and savage form concealed a magnanimous
