pretenfions which the bishop of Constantinople derived from the 2——v--1

choice of the people, and the approbation of the emperor. But
Gregory soon became the viCtim of malice and envy. The bishops
of the East, his strenuous adherents, provoked by his moderation in
the affairs of Antioch‚ abandoned him, without support, to the ad-
verse facition of the Egyptians; who disputed the validity of his
eleetion, and rigoroussy asserted the obsolete canon, that prohibited
the licentious praefice of episcopal transsations. The pride, or the
humility, of Gregory prompted him to decline a contest which
might have been imputed to ambition and avarice3 and he publicly
offered, not without some mixture of indignation‚ to renounce the
government of a church, which had been restored, and almost cre-
ated, by his labours. His resignation was accepted by the synod,
and by the emperor, with more readiness than he seems to have
expested. At the time when he might have hoped to enjoy the
fruits of his vi&ory, his episcopal throne was filled by the senator
Nectarius3 and the new archbishop, accidentally recommended
by his easy temper and venerable aspect, was obliged to delay
the ceremony of his eonsecradon, till he had previoussy dispatched
therites of his baptism ⁴⁶. After this remarkable experience of the
ingratitude of princes and prelates‚ Gregory retired once more to his
obscure solitude of Cappadocia3 where he employed the remainder

of his life, about eight¹ years, in the exereises of poetry and devo-v

tion. The title of Saint has been added to his name3 but the ten-
