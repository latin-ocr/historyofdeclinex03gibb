THE DECLINE AND FALL

colony of Mauritania, sixteen miles to the east of Caesarea, had been
distinguished, in every age, by the orthodox zeal of its inhabitants.
They had braved the fury of the Donatists ¹²¹ ; they refisted, or eluded,
the tyranny of the Arians. The town was deserted on the approach
