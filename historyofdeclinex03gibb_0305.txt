OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

“ and this infamous broker of the empire appreciates and divides
“ the Roman provinces, from Mount Haemus'to the Tigris. One
‘⁴ man, at the expence of his villa, is made proconsul of Afia; a
“ second purchases Syriawith his wife's jewels3 and a third la-
“ ments, that he has cxchanged his paternal estate for the govern-
“ ment os Bithynia. In the antichamber of Eutropius, a large tablet
“ is exposed to public view, which marks the respec‘tive prices of
‘⁶ the provinces. The different value of Pontus, of Galatia, of Ly-
“ dia, is accurately distinguished. Lycia may be obtained for so
“ many thousand pieces of gold ; but the opulence of Phrygia will
“ require a more considerable sum. The eunuch wishes to obliterate,
,“ by the general disgrace, his personal ignominy3 and as he has
“ been sold himself, he is defirous of selling the rest of mankind.
“ In the eager contentiori, the balance, which 'contains the fate and
“ fortunes of the* province, often trembles on the beam3 and till
‘⁶ one of the scales is inclined, by a superior weight, the mind of
⁷“ the impartial judge remains in anxious suspense¹¹. >Such” (continues
the indignant poet) “ are the fruits of Roman valour, of the defeat of
‘⁴ Antiochus, and os the triumph of Pompey.” This venal prostitution
of public honours secured the impunity offitture erimes; but the riches,
which Eutropius derived from confiscation, were already stained with
v injustice; since it was decent to accuse, and to condemn, the proprietors
of the wealth which he was impatient to confiscate. Some noble blood
¹was {hed by the hand of the executioner3 and the most inhospitable
extremities of the empire were filled with innocent and illustrious
exiles. Among the generals and consuls of the East, Abundantius ¹²
