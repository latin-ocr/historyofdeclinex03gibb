THE DECLINE AND FALL

was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their residence in
Italy, and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and pro-
vinces. This dangerous novelty impaired the strength, and fomented
the vices, of a double reign: the instruments of an oppreffiff and
arbitrary system were multiplied ; and a vain emulation of luxury,
not of merit, was introduced and supported between the degenerate
successors of Theodosius* Extreme distress, which unites the virtue
of a free people, embitters the faetions of a declining monarchy. The
hostile favourites of Arcadius and Honorius betrayed the republic to
its common enemies3 and the Byzantine court beheld with indif-
ference„ perhaps with pleasure, the disgrace' of Rome, the missor--
‘tunes of Italy, and the loss of the West. Under the succeeding
rcigns, the alliance of the two empires *was* restored ; but the-aid of
the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and ineffeetual ; Δ and the
national schism of the Greeks and Latins was enlarged by the perpe-
wal difference of language and manners, of interest, and even of
religion: Yet the salutary event approved in some measure the
'judgment of Constantine. During a long period of decay, his im-
pregnable city repelled the vietorious armies of Barbarians, p1·ote61ed
the wealth of Afia, and commanded, both in peace and war, the
important streights which connect the Euxine and Mediterranean
seas. The foundation of Constantinople more effentially contributed
to the preservation of the East, than to· the ruin of the We'st:

¹As the happiness of 'a future life is the great obje& of religion,
we may hear without surprise or standan, that the introdud‘tjom or
at least the abuse{ of Christianity, had some influence on the decline
and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy successfully preached
the doctrines of patience and pufillanimity;”the aecive virtues of
society were discouraged; and the last remains of military spirit were
buried in the cloyster: a large portion of public and private wealth
was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion3
