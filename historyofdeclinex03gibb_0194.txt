opposition which was made to the authority of Constantine, pro-
ceeded not so much from the powers of government, or the spirit of
the people, as from the private zeal and interest of the family of
Theodofius. Four brothers ⁹⁷ had obtained, by the favour of their
kinsman, the deceased emperor, an honourable rank, and ample
poss'eflions, in their native country: and the grateful youths resolved
to risk those advantages in the service of his son. After an unsuc-
cessful effort to maintain their ground at the head of the stationary
troops of Lusitania, they retired to their estates 3 where they armed
and levied, at their own expence, a considerable body of ssaves and
dependents, and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the
Pyrenaean mountains. This domestic insurreffifion alarmed and per-
plexed the sovereign of Gaul and Britain ; and he was compelled to
negociate with some troops of Barbarian auxiliaries, for the service
of the Spanish war. They were distinguished by the title of Hono-
rians⁹⁸; a name which might have reminded them of their fidelity
to their lawful sovereign ; and if it should candidly be allowed that
the Scots were influenced by any partial affection for a Britiffi prince,
the Moors and the Marcomanni could be tempted only by the pro-
fuse liberality of the usurpes, who distributed among the Barbarians
the military, and even the civil, honours of Spain. The nine bands
of Honorians, which may be easily 'traced on the establishment of the
&Vestem empire, could not exceed the number of five thousand
men3 yet this inconfiderable force was sufficient to terminate a war,
