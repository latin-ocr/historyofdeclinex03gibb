THE DECLINE AND FALL

authentic testimony has encouraged an opinion, that the rapine of
the Franks was not model-cited, or dffguised, by the forms os a
legal divis10n3 that they dispersed themselves over the provinces of
Gaul, without order or contr0u13 and that each victorious robber,
according to his wama, his avarice, and his strength, measured, with
his sword, the extent of his new inheritance„ At a distance from
their sovereign, the Barbarians might indeed be tempted to exer-eise
such arbitrary depredation; but the firm and artful policy of Clovis
must curb a licentious spirit, which would aggravate the mi'sery of
the vanquilhed, whilst it corrupted the union‚ and discipline of the
conquerors. The memor-able vase of Soissons is a monument, and a
pledge, of the regular distribution of the Gallie spoils. It was the
duty, and the interest, of Clovis to provide rewards for a successful
army, and settlements for a numerous people; without inffiffing
any wanton‚ or superfluous injuries, on the loyal catholics of Gaul.
The ample fund, which he might lawfully acquire, of the Imperial Ι
patrimony, vacant lands, and Gothic usurpations‚ would diminish
the cruel neceffity of seizure and confiscati0n3 and the humble pro-
vincials would more patiently acquiesce in the equal and regular
distribution of their loss ⁸⁷.

The wealth of the Merovingian princes eonfisted in their exten-
five domain. After the conquest of Gaul, they still delighted in the

rustic fimplicity of their ancestors ·: the cities were abandoned to soli·-

occafionallyescattered in the laws of the Bur-
gundians (tit. liv. NQ 1, 2. in torn. iv. p. 271,
27²⁰), and Vifigothsss. x. tit. i. N⁰ 8, 9, ιὺ.
in tom. iv. p. 428, 429, 430.)‚ are (kilfully
explained by the president Montesquieu
(Esprit des Loix, 1. xxx. c. 7, 8, 9.). Ι shall
only add, that, among the Goffis, the divi-
sion seems to have been ascertained by the
judgment of the neighbourhood; that the
Barbarians frequently usurped the remaining

their right, unless they were bari-cd bya pre·
scription of fifty years.

·⁸⁷ It is singular enough, that the president
de Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l. xxx. c. 7.),
and the Abbf: de Mably (Observation's, tom.
i. p. 21, 22.)‚ agree in this strange sup-
pofition of arbitrary and private rapine.
The count de Boulainvilliers (Etat de la
Franco, tom. i. p. zz, 23.) {hews a strong
undet-standing, though a cloud of ignor-auce,

:bird3 and, that the Romans might recov-er and prejudice.
