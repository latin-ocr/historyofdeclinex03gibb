o‘F THE 'ROMAN '·E·M‘P'1·R·1‹:,

¹ss's'ooner had Maximin advanced about two milestrom the Danube,
*than he began to experieuce the fafiidious insolence of the conqueror.
He was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley, lest he

’ should infringe the distant avve that was due to the royal mansion.

The ministers of Attila preffed him to communicate the business, and
'the instructions, which he reserved for the ear of their sovereign.
When Maximin temperately urged the contrary practice of na·-
