OF THE ROMAN EMPIRF. 55

tence and the execution, may be accepted as the worthy fruits of his (ἶχξῖωῑῖιῗῖ
repentance⁹⁹. Posterity has applauded the virtuous iirmnessof the k-——v--ae
archbissiop: and the example of Theodosius may prove the bene-
ficial influenee of those p1·inciple8‚ which could force a monarch,
exalted above the apprehension of human punishment, to respect the
laws, and ministers, of an invifible Judge. “ The prince‚” says
Montesquieu, “ who is aduated by the hopes and fears of religion,
‘⁶ may be compared to a lion, docile only to the voice, and traetable

“ to the hand, of his keeper ¹⁰⁰.'’ The motions of the royal animal
will therefore depend on the inclination, and interest, of the man
who has acquired such dangerous authority over him ; and the
priest, who holds in his hand the conscience of a king, may inflame,
or moderate, his sanguinary passions. ¹ The cause of humanity, and
that of persecution, have been asserted, by the same Ambrose, with
equal energy, and with equal success.

After the defeat and death of the tyrant of Gaul, the Roman Generofityof
world was in the poffeflion of Theodofius. He derived from the 3322?ss
choice of Gratian his honourable title to the provinces of the 391·
East: he had acquired the West by the right of conquest ; and the
three years, which he spent in Italy, were usefully employed to re·-
store the authority of the laws3 and to corre& the abuses, which had
prevailed with impunity under the usurpationof Maximus, and the
minority of Valentinian. The name of Valentinian was regularly
inserted in the public acts: but the tender age, and doubtful saith,
of the son of Justina, appeared to require the prudent care-offan,
