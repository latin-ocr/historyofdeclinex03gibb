or THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Syrian Domninus was corrupted, or deceived, by the liberal favour
of the court of Treves ; and the council of Milan obstinately rejected
the suspicion of danger, with a blind coufideucc, which was the
effeet, not of courage, but of sear. The march of the auxiliaries
was guided by the ambaffad0r3 and they were admitted, without
distrust‚ into the fortreffes of the Alps.> But the crafty tyrant fol-
lowed, with hasty and-filcnt food'ceps, in the rear3 and, as he dili·-

gently intercepted all intelligence of his motions, the gleam of ar«
mour, and the dust excited by the troops of cavalry, first announced »

the hostile approach of a stranger to the gates of Milan. In this
extremity‚ Justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence7
and the perfidious arts of Nlaximus; but they wanted time, and
force, and resolution, to stand against the Gauls and Germane, either

in the field,ror within the walls of a large and disaffeeted city.·
Flightlwas. their only‘hope‚ Aquileia their only refuge3 and as·
Maximus now displayed his genuine character, the brother cf Gra-

tian mightexpe& the same fate from the hands of the same affaffin. >
Maximus entered'Milan in triumph3 and if the wife archbishop re- -

fused ἐι dangerous and criminal connection with the usurper‚ he might

indireffly cont-ribute to the success of his arms‚- by inculcating, fr0m>

the pulpis, the· duty of resignation, rather than >that of refistance⁷*.
The unfortunate Justina reached Aquileia in safety ; but she distrusted

’ the strength of the fortifications; she dreaded the event of a siege 3 ,
and she resolved‘ to implore the protection of the great Theodosius³<
whose power and‘virtue were celebrated in all* the countries of the·
West. A veffel was seeretly provided to transport the Imperial fa-h‘
mily3 they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure ⁷ har- j
bours *of Venetia, or Istria ; traverljed 'the wh'oleextent of the Hadria- -
tic and Ionian feasg turned ‘the extreme promontory of Peloponnew·

⁷⁴ Batonius (A. D. 387. N0s63.) applies to this season of public distress some of the
penitential sermons of the archbishop2 .
