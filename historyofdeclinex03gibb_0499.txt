dominions, became the immediate reward of his perfidy. The selfiss1 k--v—-d

policy of Ricimer encouragcd him to invade the provinces which were
in the poffeflion of AEgidius, his rival; but the adlive count, by the
defence of Arles‚ and the viilory of Orleans, saved Gaul, and
checked, during his lifetime, the progr-ess of the Visigoths. Their
ambition was soon rekindled3 and the design of extinguissii'ng the
Roman empire in Spain and Gaul, was conceived, and almost com-

pleted, in the reign of Euric, who assaflinated his brother Theodorst„
and displayed, with a more savage temper, superior abilitIes, both in
peace and war. He pafl'ed the Pyreuees at the head of a numerous
army, subdued the cities of Saragoffa and Pampehma, vanquissoed
in battle the martial nobles of the Tarragonese province, carried his
vi&orious arms into the heart of Lufitania, and permitted the Suevi
to hold the kingdom of Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of
Spain ⁹². The efforts of Euric were not less vigorous,⁸ or less sue-
cessful, in Gaul3 and throughout the country that extends from
the Pyrenees to the Rhone and the Loire, Ber-ry, and Auvergne,
were the only cities‚ or dioceses, which refused to acknowledge him
as their master ⁹³. In the defence of Clermont‚ their principal town,
the inhabitants of Auvergne sustained, with inflexible resolution, the
miseries of war, pestilence, and famine3 and the Vifigoths‚ relin-
quishing the fruitless siege, suspended the hopes of that important
conquest. The youth of the province were animated by the heroic,
,and almost incredible„ valour of Ecdicius, the son of the emperor
Avitus ⁹⁴, who made a desperate sally with only eigh‘teen horsemen,
