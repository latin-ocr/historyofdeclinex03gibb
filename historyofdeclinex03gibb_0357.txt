OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 339
By these severities, which obtained the warmest approbation Of St· CXJXQJ’·

Augustin²⁰‚ great numbers of Donatists were reconciled to the Ca- z--v———J

tholie church : but the famatics, who still persevered in their opposi-
tion, were provoked to madness and despair; the distraCced country
was filled with tumult and bloodshed ; the armed troops of Circum-
cellions alternately pointed their fage against themselves, or against
threir adversaries ; and the calendar of martyre, received on both
fides a confiderable augmentation ²¹. Under these circumstances,
Genseric, a Christian, but an enemy of the orthodox communion,
· shewed himself to the Donatists as a powerful delivercr, from whom
they might reasonably expe& the repeal of the odious and oppreffive
edidis of the Roman e·1nperors²². The conquest of Africa was faci-
litated by the active zeal, or the secret favour,- of a domestic faetion 3
the wantonvoutra'ges against the ¹churches, and the clei-gy, of which
the Vandals are accused, may be fairly imptite'd to the fanaticisiri‘ of

their allies ; and the intolerant spirit, which disgraced· the triumph of

Christianity‚ contributed to the loss of the most important province
of the West ²³.

²² According to St. Augustin and Theo-

ἕο St. Augustin altered his opinion with
regard to the proper treatment of here'tics.

His¹pathetic declaration of pity and indul-
gence for the Manichaeans, has been inserted
by Mr. Locke (vol. iii. p. 469.) among the
choice specimens of his common-place book.
Another philosopher, the celebrated Bayle
(tom. ii: p. 445—496.), has refuted‚ with
superfluous diligente and ingenuity, the ar-
guments, by which the bishop of Hippo justi-

* fied, in his old age, the persecution of the

Donatista.

principles, or at least to the party, of the
Arians‚ which Genseric supported. Tille-

²³ See Baronius, Annal. Eccles. A. D.
428. ΝΟ 7. Α. D. 439. Νο 35. The car-
dinal, though moreinclined to seek the cause
of great events in heaven than on the earth,
has observed the apparent connection of the
Vandals and the Donatists. Under the reign
of the Barbarum, the schismatics of Africa
enjoyed an obscure peace os one hundred
year53 at the end of which, we may again
trace them by the light of the Imperial per-
secutions. Seer Tillemont, Mem. Eccles„
tom. vi. p. 192,1&c.
