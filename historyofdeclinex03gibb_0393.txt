OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Attila, on his side, was satisfied, and deceived, by their solemn as-
severation, that the rest of the captives had been put to the-sword ;
and that it was their constant practice, immediately to dismiss the
Romans and the desertcrs, who had obtained the security of the pub-
lic saith. „This prudent and officious diffimulation may be con-
demned, or excused, by the casuists, as they incline to the rigid de—
cree of St. Augustin‚ or to the milder sentiment of St. Jerom and
St. Chrysostom: but every soldier, every statesman‚ must acknow-

Iedge, that, if the race of the Azimuntines had been encouraged and
multiplied, the Barbarians would have ceased to trample on the
majesty of the empire ³⁷. ¹

It would have been strange, indeed, if Theodofius had purchased,
by the loss of honour, a secure and solid tranquillity3 or if his tame-
ness had not invited the repetition of injuries. The Byzantine court
was insulted by five or fix succeffive embaffies³⁸; and the ministers
of Attila were uniformly instruc‘ted to press the tardy or imperfe&

execution of the last treaty3 to produce the names of fugitives and

deserters‚ who were still proteeted by the empire3 and to declare„

with· seeming moderafion, that unless their sovereign obtained com-

plete and immediate satisfaction, it would be impoffible for him‚.

were it even his wilh, to check the resentment of his warlike tribes.

fluenced by the less· honourable view of enriching his favourites at¹

·the expence of his enemi'es.
