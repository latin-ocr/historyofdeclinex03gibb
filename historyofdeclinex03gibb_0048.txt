direct the conscience of the emperors, and to controul the admini-
stration of the empire. Gratian loved and revered him as a father ς
and the elaborate treatise on the saith of the Trinity, was defigned
for the insti-uffion of the young prince. After his tragic death, at a
time when the empress Justina trembled for her own safety, and Δ
for that of her son Valentinian‚ the archbishop of Milan was dis-
patched, on two different embassies, to the court of Treves. He exer-
cised, with equa] firmness and dexter-ity, the powers of his spiritual
and poli-tical characterem and perhaps contributed, by his authority
and eloquence, to check the ambition of Maximus, and to prote&
the peace of Italy⁶². Ambrose had devoted his life, and his abilities‚
to the service of the church. Wealth was the obje& of his con- i
tempt ; he had renounced his private patrimony3 and he sold, with-
out hefitation‚ the consecrated plate for the redemption of captives.
The clergy and people of Milan were attached to their archbiihop ;
and he deserved the esteem, without soliciting the favour, or appre-
hending the displeasure, of his feeble sovereigns.

The government of Italy, and of the young emperor, naturally
devolved to his >mother Justina, a woman of beauty and spirit, but
who, in the midst of an orthodox vpeople, had the misfortune of
profeffing the Arian heresy, which she endeavoured to instil into the
mind of her son. Justina was persuaded, that a Roman emperor
might claim, in his own dominions, the public exercise of his reli-
gion 3 and she proposed to the archbishop, as a moderate and rea-
sonable conceffion, that he should reiign the use of a fingle chureh,
either in the city or suburbs of Milan. But the eonduec of Ambrose
was governed by very different principles⁶³. The palaces of the
