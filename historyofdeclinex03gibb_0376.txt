THE DECLINE AND FALL

and hc had a custom of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished
to enjoy⁹ the terror which he inspircd. Yet this savage hero *was
not inacceffible to pity z his suppliant enemies might confide inthe
affurance of peace or pardon ; and Attila was confidered by his sub·-
j effits as=a just and indulgent master. He delighted in war3 but, after
he had ascended the throne in a mature age, his head, rather than
his hand, atchieved the conquest of the North ; and the fame of an
adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent and
successful general. The effects of personal valour are so inconsider-
able‚ except in poetry or romance, that vi&ory‚ even among Bar-
barians, must depend on the degree of skill, with which the paffions
of the multitude are combined and guided for the service of a single
man. The Scythiam conquerors, Attila and Zingis, surpass'ed their
rude countrymen in art, rather than in courage3 and it may be ob-
scrved, that the monarchies, both of the Huns, and cf the Moguls,
were erected >by their founders on the bafis of popular superstition.
The miraculous conception, which fraud and credulity ascribed to
the virgin-mother of Zingis, raised him above the level of human
nature 3 and the naked prophet, who, in the name of the Deity, in-
vested him with the empire of the earth, pointed the valour of the
Moguls with irresistible enthufiasm ⁷. The religious arts of Attila
were not less skilfully adapted to the character of his age mid
country. It was natural enough, that the Scythians should adore,
with peculiar devotion, the god of war3 but as they were incapeble
of forming either an abstra& idea, or a corporeal representation,·they
worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of an iron cimeter ³.
