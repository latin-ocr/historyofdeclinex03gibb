quent complaint3 and secretly destined the daughter of the philosb- ΟΧῙΞΧἜΡ·
pher Leontius for the future wife of the emperor of the East, who ι-Ν
had now attained the twentieth year of his age. She easlly excited
the curiosity of her brother, by an interesting picture of the charms
of Athenais ; large eyeS, a well-proportioned nose, 3 fair co'mplexion,
golden locks, a ssender person, a graceful demeanour, an under-
standing improved by ssudy, and a virtue tried by disti-ess. Theo-
dofius, concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his fister, was
permitted to behold the Athenian virgin: the modest youth imme-
diately declared his pure and honourable love ; and the royal nup-
tials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital and the
provinces. Athenais‚ who was easily persuaded to renounce the
errors of Paganism, received-at her baptism the· Christian name of

of a daughter, who espoused, fifteen years afterwards, the emperor·
of the West. The brothers of Eudocia obeyed, with some anxiety,
her Imperial summons ; but, as she could easily forgive their for-
tunate unki'ndness, she indulged· the tenderness‚ or perhaps the vansty,

In the luxury of the palace, she still cultivated those ingenuous arts,
which had contributed to her great'nes83 and wisely dedicated her
talents ‘to the honour of religion, and of her husband. Eudocia
composed a poetical paraphrase of the first eight books of the Old
Testament,·and of the prophecies of Daniel and Zachariah; a cento
of the verses of Homer, applied to the life and miracles of Christ„
the legend of St. Cyprian, and a panegyric on the Persian 1116101155-
