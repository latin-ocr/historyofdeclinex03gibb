and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the Imperial city,
which had subdued and civiliscd so considerable a part of mankind,
was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of Germany and
Scythia ⁹⁷.

The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a·
vanquishcd city, distovered, however, some regard for the lau-s of
humanity and religion. Hc encournged his troops boldly to sei'ze
the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils ofa
Wealthy and effeminate people: but he exhorted them, at the same
time, to spare the lives of the unrefisting citizens, and to respe& the
churches of the apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, as holy and invio-
lable sanetum-ies. Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult, severa}
