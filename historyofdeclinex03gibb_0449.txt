OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

‘¹‘ vocations3 I only know, that you have acted like a man who

“* cuts off his right hund with his left⁷³.’'

The luxury of Rome seems to have attracted the long and sre-
queut vifits' of Valentinian; who was consequently more despiscd
at Rome than in any other part of his dominions. A republican
spirit was insenfibly revived in the senate, as their authority, and
even their supplies, became necess'ary for the support of his feeble

governmeut. The stately demeanour of an hereditary monarch
offended their pride ; and the pleasures of Valentinian were injurious

to the peace and honour of noble fanniicts. The birth of the
vempress Eudoxia was equal to his own, and her charms and tendet
affection desei-ved those testimonies of love, which her inconstant
hulband diffipated in vague and unlawful amours. Petronius Maxi-
mus, α wealthy senator of the Anician family, who had been twice
consul, was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife: her obstinate
refistance served only to irritate the desires of Valentinian ; and he
resolved to accompliih them either by stratagem or force. Deep
gaming was one of the-vices of the court: the emperor, who, by
chance or confflvzmce, hadgained srom Maximus a confiderable sum,
uncourteoussy exacted his ring as a security for the debt; and
’ sent' it by a= trusty meffenger to his wife, with an order, in her
husband’s name, that she should immediately attend the empress
· Eudoxia. The unsuspesting wife of Maximus was conveyed in her
¹ litter to the Imperial palace; the emiffaries of her impatient lover
*conducted her to a remote andfilent bedss-chamber3 and Valentinian
violate& without remorse, the laws of hospitalityz. Her tears, when
'ssie returned 'home3 her deep affliction3 and her bitter reproaches
¹against a hulband, whom she ‘confidered as the accomplice of his
