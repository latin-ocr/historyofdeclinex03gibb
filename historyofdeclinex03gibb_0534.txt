that they were much less apprehenfive of an encounter with the
sierccst Barbarians ³⁵.

Superstition has often framed and consecrated the fantastic garments
of the monks ³⁹: bur their apparent singularity sometimes proceeds
from their uniform attachment to a fimple and primitive model,
which the revolutions of falhion have made ridiculous in the eyes of
mankind. The father of the Benedif'tines expressly disclaims all idea
of ehoice, or merit3 and soberly exhorts his disciples to adopt‘the
coarse and convenient dress of the countries which they may in-

habit ⁴⁰. The monastic habits of the ancients varied with the climate,
and their mode of life3 and they assumed, with the same indifference,

the ssieep-{kin of the Egyptian peasants, or the cloak of the Grecian
philosophers. They allowed themselves the use of linen in Egypt,
where it was a cheap and domestic manufaeture; but in the West,
they reje&ed such an expenfive article of ‘foreign luxury ⁴¹. It was
the praCtice of the monks either to cut or {have their hair ς’ they

wrapped their heads in a cowl, to escape the sight of profane obje&s ;
their legs and feet were naked, except in the* extreme cold o'f
winter3 and their fiow and feeble steps were supported by a long

staff. The aspe& of a genuine anachoret was horrid and disgusting:
every sensation that is offenfive to man, was thought acceptable to

G0d3 and the angelic rule of Tabenne condemned the salutary custom*
of bathing the limbs in water, and of anointing them with oil⁴²ss⁴
