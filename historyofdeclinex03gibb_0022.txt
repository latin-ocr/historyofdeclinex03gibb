4 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Cxlffvffi'p· of Gratiam, he had applied himself, with singular inclination and

k-aew-——d success, to manage the horse, to draw the bow, and to dart the
javelin 3 and these qualificationS, which might be useful to a soldier,
were prostituted to the viler purposes of hunting. Large pai-ks were
inelosed for the Imperial pleasures, and plentifully stocked with every
species of wild beasts; and Gratian neglected the duties, and even
the dignity, of his rank, to consume whole days in the vain display
of his dexterity and boldness in the chace. The pride and wish
of the Roman emperor to excel in an art, in which he might be
surpaffed by the meanest of his ssaves, reminded the numerous spec-
tators of the examples of Nero and Commodus: but the chaste and
temperate Gratian was a stranger to their monstrous vices ; and his
hands were stained only with the blood of animale ⁶.

, As long ass the young empIeror was guided by the irlistrucfionsjof his
masters, he profeffed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers;
many of his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the

camp ; and the health‚ the comforts, the rewards, the honours, of
his faithful troops, appeared to be the object of his attentive concern.
But, after Gratian more freely indulged his prevailing taste for hunt-
ing and ssiooting, he naturally connected himself with the most dex-
terous ministers of his favourite amusement. A body of the Alani
was received into the military and domestic service of the palace;
and the admirable skill, which they were accustomed to display in· the
unbounded plains of Scythia,was exercised, on a more narrow theatre,
in the parks and inclosures of Gaul. Gratian admired' the talents
