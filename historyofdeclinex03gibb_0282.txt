THE DECLINE AND FALL

again listened to the dietatcs of love and prudence; and soon satisfied
the brother of Placidia, by the affurance that he would immedi-
ately transmit, to the palace of Ravenna, the heads of the two
tyrants, Jovinus and Sebastian. The king os the Goths executed
his promise without difficulty or delay : the hclpless brothers, unsup-

perpetual exile in the isse of Lipari, where he was supplied with the
decent neceffaries of life. The remainder of the reign of Honorius
was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed, that, in the
space of five years, seven usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a

of Rome, by the sea, by the memmius, and by⁵intermediate pro-
vinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and seques-
