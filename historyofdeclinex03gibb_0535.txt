oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The austere monks ssept on the ground, on a hard mat, or a rough

blanket; and the same bundle of palm-leaves served them as a seat
in the day, and a pillow in the night. Their original cells were
low narrow huts‚ built of the ssightest materials; which formed, by
the regular distribution of the streets‚ a large and populous village,
incloling, within the common wall, a church, an hospital, perhaps
a library‚ some necessary offices, a garden, and a fountain or reservoir
of fresh water. Thirty or forty brethren composed a family of se-

parate discipline and diet3 and the great monasteries of Egypt con-
fistecl of thirty or forty families.

Pleasure and guilt are synonymous terms in the language of the
monks: and they had discovered, by experience, that rigid fasts,
and, abstemious diet, are the most effeCiual preservatives against the
impuredefires of the flesh ⁴³. The rules of abstinence, which they
imposed, or praffised, were not uniform or perpetual: the cheer-
ful festival of the Pentecost was balanced by the extraordinary mor-
tification of Lent; the fervour of new monasteries was insenfibly re‘-
laxed5 and the voracious appetite of the Gauls could not imitate
the patient, and temperate, virtue of the Egyptians ⁴⁴. The disciples
of Anthony and Pachomius were satisfied with their daily pittance ⁴⁵,

cated amidst the poverty of Ireland, as rigid
perhaps, and inflexible, as the abstemious vir-
