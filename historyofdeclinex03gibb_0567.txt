OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 549

inflamed by zeal, and perl a.ps by ambstion, was tempted to violate C H A P
the duties of a son, and a subje&; and the Catholics of Spain, al- ὲὲ-ξΥ-Ι-ΙΑ
though they could not complain of persecution‚ applauded his pinus

rebellion against an heretical father. The civil war was protracted

by the long and obstinate fieges of Merida, Cordova, and SeviHe,s

which had strenuoussy espoused the party of Hermenegild. He in-

vited the orthodox Barbarians, the Suevi, and the Franks, to the
destruction of his native land: he solicitcd the dangerous aid of the
Romans, who poffeffed Africa, and a part of the Spanish coast ;v and

*his holy ambaffador, the archbiffiop Leander, effectually negociatedr
in person with the Byzantine court. But the hopes of the Catholics

were crushed by the active diligence of a monarch who commanded
the troops and treasures of Spain ; and the guilty Hermenegild‚ after
his vain attempls to refist or to escape, was compelled to surrender
himself into the hands of an incensed father. Leovigild was still
mindful of that sacred character ; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal
ornaments, was still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the Cas
·tholic religion. His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at length*
provoked the indignation of the Gothic king; and the sentence of
death, which he pronounced with apparent reluctance, was privately
executed m the tower of Seville. The inflexible constancy with which
he refused to accept the Arian communion, as the price of his safety‚

may excuse the honours that have been paid to the memory of St.

Hermenegild. His wife and infant son were detained by the Ro„
mans in ignominious captivity÷ and this domestic misfortune tar-
niffied the glories of Leovigild, and embittered the last· moments off

his life²

His son and successor, Recared, the first Catholic king of Spain, Co„
had imbibed the saith of his unfortunate brother, which he supported fffiegarzdl

with more prudence and success. Instead of revolting against his gpghrjf’ of

father, Reeared patiently expected the hour of his death. Instead5 ‘⁴23- ΟΠ 5 96-
