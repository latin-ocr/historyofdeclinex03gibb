sius. They inccffintly laboured, by dark and treacherous machina·-⁴¹
tione, to deprive him of the esteern of the prince, the respect of the·
people‚ and the friendihip of the Barbarians. The life of Stilicho
was repeatedly attempted by the dagger of hired affaffin85 and a«
decree was obtained, from th'e senate of Constantinople‚ to declare
him an enemy of the republic, and to confiscate his ample poffeffions
in the provinces of the East. At a time when the only hope of de-

and reciprocal aid, of all the nations to whom it had been gradually·
communicated‚ the subjed'ts of Arcadius and Honorius were instrueted„

hostile, light; to rejoice in their mutual calamities‚ and to -em-

entertained for the rude inhahitants of the West. The distinction off

history, to prosecute, without interruption‚ the. disgraceful, but mem
