OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

and the soldiers pay was lavilhed on the useless multitudes os both
sexes, who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity.
Faith, zeal, curiosity, and the more earthly passions of malice and
ambidon, kindled the flame of theological discord3 the church‚ and

philosopher may be permitted to enlarge his views, and to confidet
