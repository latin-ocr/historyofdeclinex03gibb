been depofited above three hundred years. Immediately under the
pavement of the church two perse& sszeletons were found ⁶³„ with the
heads separated from their bodies, and a plentiful effufion of blood.
The holy reiics wele presented, in solemn pomp, to the veneration
of the people3 and every circumstance of this fortunate discovery
was admirably adapted to promote the defigns of Ambrose. The
bones of the martyrs, their blood, their garments, were , supposed to
contain a healing power3 and the praeternatural influence was com-
municated to the most distant ‚ob-ietsts,¹ without lofing any part of its
original virtue. The extraordinary cure of a blind man ⁵⁹, and the
reluctant confeffions of several daemoniacs, appeared to justify the
saith and sanCtity of Ambrose; and the truth of those miracles is
attested by Ambrose himself, by his secretary Paulinus, and by his
proselyte, the celebrated Augustin, who, at that time, profeffed the
art of rhet-oric in Milan. The reason of the present age may possibly
