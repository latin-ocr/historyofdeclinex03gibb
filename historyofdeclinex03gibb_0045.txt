‘che merit of an early repentance. If any credit could be allowed to
confeffions extorted by fear or pain‚and to vague reports‚the offspring
of malice and credulity‚ the heresy of the Priscillianists would be
found to include the various abominations of magio, of impiety, and
of lewdness⁵⁶. Priscillian, who wandered about the world in the
company of his spiritual fisters, was aceused of praying stark-naked
in the midst of the congregation; and it was confidently asserted,
that the effedts of his criminal intercourse with the daughter of Eu⁶²
chrocia, had been suppreffed‚ by means ssiu more odious and
criminal. But an accurate, or rather a candid, enquiry, will dis-
cover, that if the Priscillianists violated the laws of nature, it was
not by the licentiousness, but by the austerity‚ of their lives. They
absolutely condemned the use of the marriage—bed ; and the peace of
families was often disturbed by indiscreet separations. They enjoined,
or recommended, a total abstinence from all animal food 3 and their
continual prayers, fasts, and vigils, inculcated a rule of stri& and
perse& devotion. The speculative tenets of the seit, concerning the
person of Christ, and the nature of the human soul, were derived
from the Gnostic and Manichaean system ; and this vain philosophy,
which had been transported from Egypt to Spain, was ill adapted to
the groffer spirits of the West. The obscure disciples of priscillian
suffered, languished, and gradually disappeared: his tenets were re·
jected by the clergy and people, but his death was the subjec't of a
t long and vehement controversy3 while some arraigned, and others
