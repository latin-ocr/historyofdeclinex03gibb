233 ‘THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

CXQXAI P. In the sack of Rome, some rare and extraordinary examples of

uu-v--t Barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded. But the holy pre-

small proportion of the Roman people: many thousand warrior-s,
more especially os the Huns, who served under the standard of
Alai-ic, were strangers to the name, or at least to the futh, of Christ;
and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour,
that, in the hour of savage licence, when every paflion was in-
flmned, and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the gospel
seldom influenced the behaviour of the Gothic Christians. The writers,
the best disposed to exaggerate ‚their clemency, have freely con—
feffed, that a cruel ssaughter was made of the Romans ¹⁰⁰3 and that
the streets of the city were filled with-dead bodies, which remained

without burial during the general consternation. The despair of the
citizens was sometimes converted into fury 3 and whenever the
Barbarians were provoked by oppofition, they extended the pro—
miscuous maffacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless. The
private revenge of forty thousand ssaves was exercised without pity
or remorse ; and the ignominious lashes, which they had formerly
received, were wassied away in the blood of the guilty, or obnoxious,
families. The matrons and yirgins of Rome were exposed to inju-
ries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself;

for the admiration of future ages ¹⁰¹. A Roman lady, of singular
