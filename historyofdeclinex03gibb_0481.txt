OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

- could not defeat the operations of the Roman emperor, who wa& at
liberty to land his troops on any part of the African coast. But
Genseric was saved from impending and inevitable min, by the

treachery of some powerful subject& envious, or apprehensive, of
their master's success. Guided by their secret intelligence‚ he sur-
prised the unguarded ficet in the bay of Carthagena: many of the ships
were sunk, or taken, or burnt; and the preparations of three years
were destroyed in a single day ⁵³. After this event, the behaviour
of the two antagonists shewed them superior to their fortune. The
Vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental viclory, immedi-

disappointments,seonsented to a treaty‚ or rather to a suspenfion os

remain ignorant of the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne
and his life. The recent {missortune of Carthagena sullied the glory„
which had dazzled the eyes of the multitude: almost every descrip-
