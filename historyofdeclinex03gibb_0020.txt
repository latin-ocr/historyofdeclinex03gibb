Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable invas10n3 and the
grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of Theodosius, to
the author ofhis greatness‚ and of the public sasety. Gratiam sur·-
vivcd those memor-able events only four or five years3 but he surv‘ived
his reputation; and, before hc fell a vifflim to rebellion, he had lost,
in a great measure, the respect and confidence of the Roman world.
The remarkable alteration of his charae‘rer or conduct, may not
be imputed to the arts of flattery‚ which had besieged the son of Va-
lentinian from his infancy3 nor to the headstrong paffions which
that gentle youth appears to have escaped. A more attentive
view of the life of Gratiam, may perhaps suggest the true cause
of the disappointment of the public hopes. His apparentvvirtues,
instead of being the har-:ly productions of experience and adverffly,
were the premature and artificial fruits of a royal education. The
anxious tenderness of his father was continually employed to bestow
on him those advantages‚ which he might perhaps esteem the more
highly, as he himself had been deprived of thern3 and the most
ssgssful masters of every science, and of every art, had laboured to

form the mind and body of the young prince ¹. The knowledge

which they painfully communicated was displayed with ostentation,
and celebrated with laviffi praise. His soft and transtable dispofition
