564 THE DECLINE AND FALL

ξωξξῶῌῗ· the valour, the conduct, and pexhaps by the piety, of C lovis and the

κ--ν-ι event of the bloody d1y decided for ever the alternative of empire
or servitude. The last king of the Alemanni was ssain‘ m the field,
and his people was ssaughtered and pursued, till they threw down
their arms, and yielded to the mercy of the conqueror. Without
discipline it was impossible for them to rally3 they had contemp,-
tuoussy demolished the walls and fortifications whichlmight have
protected their distress; and they were followed into the heart of
their forests, by an* enemy, not less afflve, or intrepid‚ than them-
selves. The great Theodoric congratulated the vidiory of Clovis,
whose fister Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married3 but he
mildly interceded with his brother in favour of the suppliants and
fugitives, who had implored his proteC‘don. The Gallie territories‚
which were poffessed by the Alemanni, became the prize of their
conqueror· ‚ and the haughty nation, invincible‚ or rebellious,
to the arms of Rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of the Me-
rovingian kings, who gracioussy permitted them to enjoy their pe-
culiar manners and institutions, under the government of official,
and, at length, of hereditary, dukes. After the conquest of
the VVestern provinces, the Franks alone maintained their ancient
habitations beyond the Rhine. They gradually subdued, and civil-
ised, the exhausted countries, as far as the Elbe, and the mountains
of Bohemia3 and the peace of Europe was secjured by the obe-
dience of Germanyu.
