of every denomination and degree, who form so considerable a part
of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might

aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and

whilst the'adjacent town of ΝΟΙειηρ has been illustrated, on this oc-

by his own pen, and by the praises of St.
Ambrose, St. Jerom, St. Augustin, sulpi-
cius severus, &c. his Christian friends aud
contemporaries.
