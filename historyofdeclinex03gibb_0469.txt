OF THE ROMAN EMP'IRE.

refisted the votes of an unarmed senate, if their discontent had not
been supported, or perhaps inflamed, by Connt Ricimer, one of the
principal commanders of the Barbarian troops, who formed the mi-

litary defence of Italy. 'she daughter of wallia, king of the Visi-
goths‚ was the mother of Ricimer ; but he was descended‚ on the

father's fide, from the nation of the Suevi²⁶: his pride, or patriot-
ism, might be exasperated by the missortunes of his country1nen;
and he obeyed, with reluctance, an emperor, in whose elevation he
'had not been consulted. His faithful and important services against
the common enemy, rendered him still more formidable²'; and,
after destroying, on the coast of Corsica, a fleet of Vandals, which
consisted of fikty gallies, Ricimer returned in triumph with the
appellation of the Deliverer of Italy. He chose that moment
to fignify to Avitus, that his reign was at an end; and the
feeble emperor, at a distance from his Gothic allies, was corn-
pelled, after a short and unavailing struggle, to abdicate the
purple. By the clemency, however, or the contempt, of Ri-
cimer ²⁸, he was permitted to descend from the throne, to the
more defirable station os bishop of Placentia: but the resentment of
the senate was still unsatisfied3 and their inflexible severity pro-
nounced the sentence of his death. He fled towards the Alps, with
'the humble hope, not of arming the Vifigoths in his cause, but of
securing his person and treasures in the sanctuary of Julian, one of
Disease, or the hand of the execu-
