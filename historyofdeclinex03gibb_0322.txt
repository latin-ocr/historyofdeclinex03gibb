public abhorrence. The secret resentment of the court encouraged

had condemned, from the pulpit, the domestic females of the clergy
of Constandnople, who, under the name of servants, or fistcrs, af-

and solitary ascetics, who had secluded themselves from the world,
were intitled to the warmest approbation of Chrysostom3 but he
despised and stigmatised‚ as the disgrace of their holy profcffion, the
crowd of degenerate monks‚ who, from some unworthy motives of
pleasure or profit, so frequently infested the streets of the capital. To

the voice of persuafion, the archbishop was obliged to add the terrors
of authority3 and his ardour, in the exercise of ecclefiastical juris-
diction, was not always exempt from paflion3 nor was it always
guided by prudence. Chrysostom was naturally of a choleric dispo-

sirion ⁴⁴. Although he struggled, according to the precepts of the

gospel, to love his private enemies‚ he indulged himself in the pri-

sentiments were sometimes delivered with too much energy of coun-

ations of heahh, or abstinence, his former habits of taking his repasts
alone ; and this inhospitable custom ⁴⁵, which his enemies imputed to
pride, contributed‚ at least, to nourish the infirmity of. a morose and
unsocial humour. Senarated from that familiar intercourse, which
