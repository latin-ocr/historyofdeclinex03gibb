OF THE ROMAN EMP1RE,

Α of the Christians was offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacri-
fice ¹¹. ’

But the Christiane formed the least numerous party in the senate
of Rome ¹²3 and it was only by their absence, that they could express
their dissent from the leg-al, though profane, aeas of a Pagan majo-
rity. In that assembly, the dying embers of' freedom were, for a
moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of fanaticism„ Four
1·espet‘.‘table deputations were succeffively voted ‘to the Imperial
court ¹³, to represent the grievances of the priesthood and the senate;
and to solicit the restoration of the altar of Victor-y. The conduec of
this important bufiness was entrusted to the eloquent Symmachus ¹⁴,

a wealthy and noble senator, who united the sacred chameiers of pon-
tjff and augur} with the civil dignities of proconsul of Africa, and
praefe& of the¹ city. The breast of Symmachus was animated by the
wal-mest zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism3 and his religious
antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius, and the inefficacy of

his moral virtues ¹ .
emperor Valenfinian, was conscious of the* difficulty and danger of

“the office which he had assumed. He cautiou-ssy avoids every topic
which might appear to reflecst on the religion of his sovereign3 hum-

The orator, whose petition is extant to the

Constantine,-does not find one Christian (Heathen Testimonies, vol. iv. p. 372—
church worthy to be named among the edi· 399.) fairly represents the whole transac-
fices of the city. Ambrose (tom. ii. epist. xvii. tion.

p. 825.) deplores the public scandals of
Rome, which continually offended the eyes,
the ears, and the nostrils of the faithful.

“¹² Ambmfe repeatedly affirms, in contra-
diction to commori sense (Moyle’s Works,
vol. ii. p. 147.)-, that the Christians had a
majority in the senate. ⁵

¹³ The βψ (Α. D. 382.) to Grat'ian,
who refused them audience. The ſscond (A.
D. 384.) to Valentinian, when the field was
disputed by Symmachus and Ambrose. The
third (Α. D. 388.) to Theodosius3 and the

vor. ΙΙΙ.

¹4 Symmachus, who was invested with all
the civil and sacerdotal honours, 'represented
the emperor under the two charaaers of Pon-
tfix Maximus, and Princeps Senatzis. See
the ‘proud inscription at the head of his
wotks.
