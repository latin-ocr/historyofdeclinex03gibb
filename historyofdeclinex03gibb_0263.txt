'oF THE Ro·MAN ΫΕΜΡΙΚΕ. 245

Gothsyevacuated the city at the end of fix· days, but Rome remained (ἵΧΗῺιὲΙ 1.
above nine months in the pofleffion of the Imperialists; and every μ-γ--ι
honr was stained by some atrocious a& of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
The authority of Alaric preserved some order and moderation among
the ferocious multitude, which ‚acknowledged him for their leader
and· king: but the constable of Bourbon had. glorioussy fallen in the
attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every re-
straint of discipline, from an army which consisted of three inde-
pendent nations, the Italiam, the Spaniards,and the Germans. In
the beginning of the fixteenth century, the manners of Italy ex·-
hibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind. They
united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of so-
ciety‚ with-the polished vices which springbfrom the abuse of art and
luxury z and the loose adventurers, who· had. violated every prejudice
of patriotism and superstition to affault the palace, of the Roman pon-
tiss, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the lta-
liam. At the same aera, the Spaniards were the terror both of the
Qld and New World: but their high—spirited valour was disgraced
by gloomy pride, rapacious murice, and unrelenting cruelty. In-
defatigable in the pursuit of farne and riches, they had improved, by
repeated praefice, the most exquihte and este& nal methods of tor-
turing their prisoners: many of the Castillans, who pillaged Rome„
were familiars of the holy inquisition· ‚ and tome volunteers, pei-:hips‚

were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico. The Ger· atvs
’were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards· and
the rustic, or even savage, aspect of those Tr zmcnsmre war orirs, often
⁷³¹disguised a simple and merciful disposition. But they h id 11 nisibed,

⁴in 'the first fervour of the reformation, the spirit, as v ell as the 111 rin-
ciple& of Luther. It was their favourite amusement to in fult, 01

-, less than a month after the affault of the city, who appears to have been an able magistrate,
‚hy the brother. of the historinn Guicciardini‚ and a dispaffionate writer.
