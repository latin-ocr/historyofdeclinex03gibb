they solemnly pronounced‚ that the life of a Roman was of smaller κ--Ὗ--ι
value than that of a Barbarian. The Antra mu, a name expres-
five of the most illustrious birth or dig‘nity among the Franks, was
appreciated at the sum of fix hundred pieces of gold; while the
noble provincial, who was admitted to the king’s table, might be
legally murdcred at the expence' of three hundred pieccs. Two
hundred were deemed sufficient for a Frank of ordinary conditiom
but the meaner Romans were exposed to disgrace and danger by a
trifling compensation of one hundred, 01· even fifty, pieces of gold.
Hadthese laws been regulated by any principle of equity or reason,
the public proteffion should have supplied in just proportion the
want of personal strength. But the legissator hadxweighed in the
scale, not of justice, but of policy, the loss of a soldier against that
of a ssave: the head of an insolent and rapacious Barbarian was
guarded by an heavy- fine ; and the ssightest aid was afforded to the
most defenceless subje&s. Time insenfibly abated the pride of the
conquerors, and the patience of the vanquished3 and the boldest
citizen was taught by‘experience‚ that he might suffer more injuries
than he could inflist. Ae the manners of the Franks became less
ferocious, their laws were rendered more severe ; and the Merovin-
gian kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigour of the Vifigoths

and Burgundians ⁷⁵. Under the empire of Charlemagne, murder was
