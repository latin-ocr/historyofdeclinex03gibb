his soldiers, deserting their standards, spread themselves over the coun-

try of their allice, vvhich they stripped of all that had been-saved from

the rapacious hands of the enemy. Alaric appears to have scized the fa-

vom-able moment to execute one of those hardy emerprises, in which

the abilities of a general are displaycd with more genuine lustre, than
