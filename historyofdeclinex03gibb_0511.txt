OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 493

ΘΥ the imperious monarch. The death of that conqueror restored Cxlsxfx‘ifsp‘
him to his freedom3 and 'Orestes might honourably rcfuse either to *mom-¹
follow the sons of Attila into the Scythian desert, or to obey the
Ostrogoths‚ who had usurpedvthe dominion of Pannonia. He pre-
ferred the service of the Italian princes, the fuccess'ors of Valentinian '3
and, as he poffeffed the qualifications of courage, industry, and expe-
