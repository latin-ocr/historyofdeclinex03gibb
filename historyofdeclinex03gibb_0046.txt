b—ae—-J can observo, the humane inconsistency of the most illustrious saints

and bishops, Ambrose of Milan ⁵⁷, and Martin of Tours ³⁸; who, on
this occaslon, asserted the cause of toleration. They pitied the un·-
happy men, who had been executed at Treves3 they refused to hold
communion with their episcopal murderers; and if Martin deviated
from that generous resolution, his motives were laudable‚ and his
repentance was exemplary. The bilhops of Tours and Milan pro-
nounced, without hesitation, the eterna} damnation of heretics ; but
they were surprised, and ssiocked, by the bloody image of their tem-
poral death, and the honest feelings of nature resisted the artificial
prej udices of theology. The humanity of Ambrose and Martin was
confirmed by the scandalous irregularity of the proceedings against
priscillian, and his adherents. The civil and eeclesiastical ministers
had transgreffed the limits of their respeCfive provinces. The secular
judgc had presumed to receive an appeal, and to pronounce a defini-

* tive sentence, in a matter of saith, and episcopal jurisdiction. The

bissiops had disgraced themselves, by exercising the functione of ac·-
cusers in a criminal prosecution. The cruelty of Ithacius ⁵⁹, who
beheld the tortures, and solicited the death, of the heretics, provoked
the just indignation of mankind ; and the vices of that profligate bi-
ihop were admitted as a proof, that his zeal was instigated by the
sordid motives of interest. Since the death of Priscillian, the rude

attempts of persecution have been refined and methodised in the
holy office, which affigns their distin& parts to the ecclefiastical
and secular powers. The devoted viritim is regularly delivered by
