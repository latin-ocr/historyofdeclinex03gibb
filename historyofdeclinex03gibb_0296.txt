THE DECLINE AND FALL

British church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops ¹³⁶, with
an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy3 and the want of

riches (for they seem to have been poor 187) would compel them to >-

deserve the public esteem, by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
The interest, as well as the temper of the clergy, was favourable
to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary
lefl'ons might be frequently inculeated in their popular discourses;
ancl the episcopal synoda were the only costncils that could pretend to
the weight and authority of a national affembly. In such coun-
cils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuoussy with the
biihops‚ the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church,
might be freely debated; differences reconciled, alliances formed,
contributions impostd, wife resolutions often concerted‚ and some-
times executed3 and there is reason to believe, that in momente of
extreme danger, a Peudragon, ormestator, was elected by the general
consent of the Britons. These pastoral cares, so worthy of the epis-
copal character, were interrupted‚ however, by zeal and superstition;
and the British clergy inceffantly laboured to eradicate the Pelagian
heresy, which they abhorred, as the peculiar disgrace of their native
country ¹³⁸.

It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that
