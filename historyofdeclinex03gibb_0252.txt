THE DECLINF. AND FALL

changed the opinions of men, and the state of public affairs. The
troops and officers, whom Attalus had sent into that province, were
defeated and ssain3 and the active zeal of Heraclian maintained his
own allegiance, and that of his people. The faithful count of Africa
transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed‘ the attachment of the
Imperial guards3 and his vigilance, in preventing the exportation of
corn and oil, introduced famine, tumult, and discontent, into the
walls of Rome. The failure of the African expedition, was the source
of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus; and
the mind of his protector was insenfibly alienated from the interest
of a prince, who wanted spirit to command, or docility to obey..
The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge,
or against the advice, of Alaric; and the obstinate refusal of the
senate, to allow, in the embarkation, the mixture even of five hun-
dred Goths, betrayed a suspicions and distrustful temper, which, in
their fituation, was neither generous nor prudent. The resentment,
of the Gothic king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius,

who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards·

excused his double perfidy, by declaring, without a blush, that he had<
only stemed to abandon the service of Honorius, more effectually
to r'uin the cause of the usurper. In a large plain near Rimini, and

in the presence of an innumerable multitude of Romans and Barba-⁴

rians, the wretched Attalus was publiely despoiled of the diadem and
purple3 and those enfigns of royalty were sent by Alaric‚ as the‘

pledge of peace and friendihip, to the son of Theodofius ⁹⁴. The
officers who returned to their duty, were reinstated in their employ-

ments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was gracioussy al-
