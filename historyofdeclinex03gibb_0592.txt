574 THE DECLrNE AND FALL

{fxiini’ss The first vidior-ybs Clovis had insulted the honour of the.G0ths.

contiguous dominions ; and after the delays of fruitless negociation,
a personal interview of the two-kings was proposed and accepted.
This conference of Clovis and Alaric was held in a small issand of
the Loire, near Amboise. They embraced, familiarly conversed,
and feasted together3 and separated with the warmest profeffions
of peace, and brotherly love. But their apparent confidence con-
cealed a dark suspicion of hostile and treacherous defigns3 and their
mutual complaints solicited, eluded, and disclaimed‚ a final arbitra-
tion. At Paris, which he already considered as his royal seat,
Clovis declared to an affembly of the princes and warriors, the pre-
tence, and the moflve, of a Gothic war. ‘⁶ It grieves me to see that

“ the Arians still poffess the fairest portion of Gaul. Let us march

“ against them with the aid of God; and,r having vanquistied the
“ heretics, we will poffess, and divide, their fertile* provinces ⁴⁶.‘’
The Franks, who were inspired· by hereditary valour and recent
zeal, applauded the generous defign. of their monarch; expreffed
their resolution to conquer or die, fince death and conquest would
be equally profitable3 and solemnly protested that* they would never
{have their beards, till vinitor-y should absolve them from that incon·-
¹venient vow. The enterprise was promoted by the public, or pri·—
vate, exhortsswtionls of Clotilda. She reminded her husband, how ⁷
