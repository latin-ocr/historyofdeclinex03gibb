THE DECLINE AND FALL

nourablc station, and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to
the miserable condition of captives and exiles. Aswhe Barbarians
had more occasion for money, than for ssaveS, they fixed, at a mo-
derate price, the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the
ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the
charity os strangers ¹⁰⁸. The captives, who were regularly sold, either

in open market, or by private conti-act, would have legally regained '.

their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose, or
to alienate ¹0⁹. But as it was soon discovered, that the vindication
of their liberty would endanger their lives; and, that the Goths,
unless they were tempted to fell, might be provoked to murder, their
useless prisoners ; the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified
by a wife regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the mo-
derate term of five years, till they had discharged by their labour the
price of their redemption ¹¹⁰. The nations who invaded the Roman
empne, had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry
and affrighted provincials, less apprehenfive of servitude than of fa-
mine. The calamities of Rome and Italy dispersed the inhabitants
to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.

coast of Campania and Tuscany, the little issand of Igilium, separated
by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or
eluded, their hostile attempts ; and at so small a distance from Rome,
great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods
os that sequestered spot¹¹¹. The ample patrimonies‚ which many
