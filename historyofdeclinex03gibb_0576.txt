THE DECLINE AND FALL

rage to defend them, they were justly condemned to obey‚ and even
to flatter‚ the νίἇὶοῑίουε Barbarians, by whose clemency they held
their precarious fortunes and their lives ⁴.

As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the &Vestem empire, he
fought the friendlhip of the most powerful of the Barbarians. The
new sovereign of Italy resigned to Euric, king of the Vifigoths‚ al}
the Roman conquests beyond the Alps, as far as the Rhine and the
Ocean⁵2 and the senate might confirm this liberal gift with some
ostentation of power, and without any real loss of revenue or domi-
nion. The lawful pretenfions of Euric were justified by ambition
and success3 and the Gothic nation might aspire‚ under his co1n-
mand, to the monarchy of Spain and Gaul. Arles and Marseilles
surrendered to his arms: he oppreffed the freedom of Auvergne3
and the bilhop condescended to purchase his recal from exile by a
tribute of just, but relufi'mnt, praise. Sidonius waited before the,
gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and suppliants ς·
and their various bufiness at the court of Bordeaux attested the
power, and the renown, of the king of the Vifigoths. The Heruli*
of the distant ocean, who painted their naked bodies, with its caeru-
lean colour, vimplored his p1·ote<‘.tion; and the Saxone respected the
maritime provinces of a prince, who was destitute of any nava] force.
The tall Burgundians submitted to his authority; nor did he restore

the captive Franks, till he had imposed on that fierce nation the “

terms of an unequal peace. The Vandals of Africa cultivated his
ufeful friendssiip3 and the Ostrogoths of Pannonia were supported by

his. powerful aid against the oppreffion of the neighbouring Huns.
