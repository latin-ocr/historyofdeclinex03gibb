Virtuez of
Theodofius.

THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

But the feeble emotion of iuva--
luntary pity was checked by his regard for public justice, and the
memory of Gratiam 3 and he abandoned the vietim to the pious zeal
of the soldiers, who drew him out of the Imperial presence, and

mind of the victorious emperor.

instantly separated his head from his body. The intelligence of his
defeat and death was received with sincere, 01· well-diffembled, joy :
his son Victor, on whom he had conferred the title of Augustus,
died by the order, perhaps by the hand, of the bold Arbogastes3
and all the military plans of Theodofius were successfully executed.
When he had thus terminated the civil war, with less difficulty and
bloodssied than he might naturally expe&‚ he employed the winter
months of his residence at Milan, to restore the state of the afflieted
provinces; and early in the spring he made, after the example of
Constantine and Constantius, his triumphal entry into the ancient
capital of the Roman empire ⁷⁷.

The orator, who may be silent without danger, may praise with-
out difficulty, and without relustance ⁷⁸3 and posterity will confess,
that the charad'oer of Theodofius ⁷⁹ might furnish the subjedl: of a fin-

of this civil war. Ambrose (tom. ii. epist.
xl. p 932, 933.) darkly alludes to the well-

applauds the peculiar merit, and good for-

tam tutum saluisse de principe (Pacat. in Pa-

negyr. Vet. xii. 2.). Latinus Pacatus Dre-
panius, a native of Gaul, pronounced this
oration at Rome (A. D. 388.). He was af—
terwards proconsul of Africa ; and his friend
Ausonius praises him as a poet, second only
to Virgil. See Tillemont, Hist. des Empe-

and the colours are mixed. The praise of
Pacatus is too vague ; and Claudian always
seems afraid of exalting the father 'above the
son.
