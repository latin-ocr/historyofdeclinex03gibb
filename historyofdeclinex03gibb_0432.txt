feffive loss, sufficient to justify the historian's remark, that whole
generations may be swept away, by the madness of kihgs, in
the space of a single hour. After the mutual and repeated dis-
,charge of miffile weapons, in which the archers of Scythia might
:fignalize their superIor dext-erity, the cavalry and infantry of the two
,armies were furioully mingled in closer combat. The Huns, who
fought under the eyes of their king, pierced through the feeble and
doubtful centre of the allies, separated their wings from each other,
and wheeling, with a rapid effort‚ to the left, dircited their whole
force against the Vifigoths. As Theodorie rode along the ranks‚ to
animate his troops, he received a mortal stroke from the javelin of
Andages, a noble Ostrogoth‚ and immediately fell from his horse.
The wounded king was oppreffed *in the general disorder, and trampled
under the feet of his own cavalry3 and this important death served to
explain the ambiguous prophecy of the Haruspices. Attila already
exulted in the confidence of victory, when the valiant Torismond
descended from the hius, and verified the remainder of the predic-
tion. The Vifigoffis, who had been thrown into eonfufion by the
flight, or defeetion, of the Alani, gradually restored their order of
