tained by fortune, was a native of Spain, the countryman‚ the
fellow-soldier, and the rival of Theodosius, whose elevation he had
not seen without some emotions of envy and resentment: the events
of his life had long fince fixed him in Britain3 and I should not be
unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage, which he is said
to have contni‘fitecl with the daughter of a wealthy lord of Caernar-
vonsstirem. But this provincial rank might justly be confidered as
a state of exile and obscurity3 and if Issaximus had obtained any
civil or military office, he was not invested with the authority
either of governor or general¹¹. His abilities‚ and even his in-
tegrity, are acknowledged by the partial writers of the age3 and
the merit must indeed have been conspicuous, that could extort such
a confeffion in favour of the vanquished enemy of Theodofius.
The discontent of Nlaximus might incline him to censure the con-

duee of his sovereign, and to encourage, perhaps without any views
of ambidon, the murmurs of the troops. But in the midst of the
tumult, he artfully‚ or modestly, refused to ascend the throne; and

some credit appears to have been given to his own pofitive de·-
claration‚ that he was compelled to accept the dangerous present of

the Imperial >purple ¹².
