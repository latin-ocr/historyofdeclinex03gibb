people. On the vigil of Easter, the solemn administration of bap-
tism was rudely interrupted by the soldiers, who alanned the mov

of Afia Minor, where he was continually threatened by the hostile
attacks of the Isaurians, and the more implacable fury of the monks.

Yet Chrysostom arrived in safety at the place of his confinement3
and the three years,= which he spent at Cucusus, and the neighbour-
