Gallicia3 where they still continued, in a narrow compass, and on
a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
In the pride of victory,¹ Wallia was faithful to his engagements: he
restored his Spanilh conquests to the obedience of Honorius-3 and
the tyranny of the Imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people
to regret the time of their Barbarian servitude. While the event of
