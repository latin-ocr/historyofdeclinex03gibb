of the Gothic poWers3 and they readily accepted their service against ΕΧῙξόέΙ P.
the tyrants and Barbarians, who infested the provinces beyond the ι-ῳ-..ι
Alps¹³⁰. Adolphus, assuming the character of a Roman general,
directed his march from the extremity of Campania to the southern
provinces of Gaul. His troops, either by force or agreement, im-

mediately occupied the cities of Narbonne‚ Thoulouse, and Bour-

deaux3 and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the

walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the Me-
diterranean to the Ocean. The oppreffed provincials might exclaim,

that the miserable temnant, which the enemy had spared, was cruelly

ravished by their pretended allies ; yet some specious colours were

not wanting to palliam, or justify‚ the violence of the Goths. The

cities of Gaul, which they attacked, might perhaps be considered as

in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the ar-

ticles of the treaty‚ or the secret instructions of the court, might
sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adol-

phus3 and the guilt of any irregular, unsuccessful, a& of hostility,

might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth‚ to the un-
governable spirit cf a Bai-barian host, impatient of peace or discipline.

The luxury of Italy had been less effectual to soften the temper, than

to relax the courage, of the Goths 3 and they had imbibed the vices,

without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society ¹³ ¹.

The professions of Adolphus were probably sincere, and his at- Itismarfiage
