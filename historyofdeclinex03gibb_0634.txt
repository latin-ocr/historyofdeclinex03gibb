THE DECLINE AND FALL

of the XVest-Saxons was laborioussy founded by the persevering
efforts of three martial generations. The life of Cerdie, one of

the bravest of the children of woden, was consumed in the conquest

·of Hainpssiire, and the Isse of Wight; and the loss which he sustainctl

in the battle of Mount Badon, reduced him to a state of inglorious
