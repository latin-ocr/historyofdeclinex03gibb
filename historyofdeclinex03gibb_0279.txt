emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respste, *-—-v--³

was again besieged in his capital by the arins of a more formidable
enemy. Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negociation
with the Franks and Alemanni3 and his ambaffador, Edobic, soon
returned, at the head of an army, to disturb the operatione of the
siege of Arles. The Roman general, instead of expecting the attack
ἱ] his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely‚ resolved to pass the Rhome,
and to meet the Barbariana. His mensures were conducted with so
much skill and semecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of Con-
stantius in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and
destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently
gained an advantageous post in their rear. The remains of the army of
Edobic were preserved by ssight or submiffion, and their leader escaped
from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend 3 who gtoo
clearly understood, that the head of his obnoxious guest wouldbe arr
“ acceptable and lucrative present for the Imperial general. ' On this.
occasion, Constantius behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine
Roman. Subduing, 01· supprefling, every sentiment of jealousy, he
pub'licly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilaszr but he
turned with horror from the affaffin of Edobic3 and sternly intimated
his· commands, that the camp should no longer be pollute‘d' by the
presence of an ungrateful wretch, who had violated* the lawaof
friendship and hospitality. The usurper, who beheld, from the walls*
bf Arles, the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some- con-5
, fidence in so generous a conqueror. He required a solemn promise
for his security3 and after receiving, by the imposition 'ofhan'ds,
the sacred character of a Christian Presbytenhe ventured, tos operi
the gates of the city. But he soon experienced, that theprinciples
of honour and integrity, which mi'ght regulate the ordinary conduct
‘of Constantius, were supersededr by the loose doctrines 0ΐῖ> politic'al

morality.
