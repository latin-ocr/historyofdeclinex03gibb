OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

It is said, that the foolissi curiosity of Elagabalus attempted to
discover, from the quantity os spiders webs, the number of the in-
habitants of Rome. A more rational method of enquiry might not
have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princea, who
could ealily have resolved a question so important for the Roman
governxnent, and so interesting to succeeding ages. The births and
deaths of the citizens were duly registered3 and if any writer of an-
tiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the
common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calcula-
tion, which would destroy the extravagant affertions of critics, and
perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philoso-
phers ⁶⁵. The most diligent researches have collected only the fol—
lowing circumstances ; which, ssight and imperfect as they are, may
tend, in some degree, to illustrate the question of the populousness
‹of ancient Rome. Ι. When the capital of the empire was besieged
>by the Goths‚ the circuit of the walls was accurately measured, by
Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty—one
miles ⁶⁶. It should not be forgotten, that the form of the city was
almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to
contain the largest space within any given circumference. Π. The
archite& Vitruvius, who flouriihed in the Augustan age, and whose
evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, ob-
serves, that the innumerable habitations of the Roman people would
*have spread themselves far beyond the nari-ow limits of the city3 and

>that the want of ground, which was probably contradi& on every

who might have given children to the state, strange dreams of four, or ·eight‚ or fourteen
but whose only occupation was to curl and milliens in Rome. Mr. Hume (Ess'ays, vol. i.
dress their hair, and jafflui volubilibus gyri8‚ p. 450 - 457.), with admirable good sense and
