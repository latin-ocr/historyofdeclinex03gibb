OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

rica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic ¹³⁵,
was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts. Britain was irre-
coverably lost ¹⁷⁶. But as the emperors wisely acquiesccd in the
independence of a remote province, the separation was not em-
bittered by the reproach of tyranny or 1·ebellion; and the claims
of allegiance and protectior] were sncceeded by the mutual and vo-

luntary offices of national friendssiip¹⁷⁷, ’

This revolution diffolved the artificia} fabric of civil and military &5³oe of Bsi-

tarn,

¹government ; and the independent country, during a period of forty A.D. 409-

years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority o
γ the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns ¹⁷³. I. Zosimus, who
⁷ alone has preserved the memory of this lingular trans-action, very
accurately observes, that the letters of Honorius were addreffed to

the cities of Britain ¹⁷⁹.

Under the protection of the Romans,
ninety-two considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of
that great province3 and, among these, thirty-three cities were distin-

guished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance ¹³⁰.

¹⁷⁵ 1 thought it neceffary to enter my pro-
test against this part ofthe system of the Abbe

produced, that the independent Britons raised
12‚000 rnen for the service of the emperor

Dubos, which Montesquieu has so vigoroussy
opposed. See Esprit des Loix‚ 1. xxx. c.
24.

figor, are the words of Procopius (de BelI.Van-
dal. l. i. c. z. p. 181. Louvre edition) in a
very important passage, which has been too
much neglefted. Even Bede (Hist. Gent.
Anglican. l. i. c- 12. p. 50. edit. Smith) ac-
knoxvledges that the Romans finally left Bri-
tain in the reign of Honorius. Yet our mo-
dern historians and antiquaries extend the
term of their dominion 3 and there are some
who allow only the interval of a few months
between their departure and the arrival ofthe
Saxons.

¹⁷⁷ Bede has not forgot the occafional aid
of the legions against the Scots and Piem
and more authentic proof will hereafter be

Anthemius, in Gaul.

¹⁷⁸ I owe it to myself, and to historic
truth, to declare, that some circumstances in
this paragraph are founded only on con·
jefture and analogy. The stubbornness
of our language has sometimes forced me to
deviate from the conditional into the indica-
ti-ve meod.

¹⁸⁰ Two cities of Britain were municipia,
nine colonia, ten Latii jure Amatne, twelve
stipendiaria? of eminent note. This detail is
taken from Richard of Cirencester, de sini
Britanniae, p. 36.; and though it may not
seem probable, that he wrote from the MSS.
of a Roman general, he shews a genuine
knowledge of antiquity, very extraordinary
for a monk ofthe fourteenth century.
