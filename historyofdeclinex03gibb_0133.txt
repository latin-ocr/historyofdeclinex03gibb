'neither able, nor deth-oue, to boast of a long series of illustrious pro-
genitore 3 and the ssight mention of his slthcr, an officer of Barba-

pind, the astonilhed crowd made room for the stranger, who displayed,
in a private condition, the awful majesty of a hero. From his earliest
youth he embraced the Profeffion of arms ; his prudence and valour

and after his return to Constantinople, his merit wagrewarded by
an intimate and honourable alliance with the Imperial family. Theo-
