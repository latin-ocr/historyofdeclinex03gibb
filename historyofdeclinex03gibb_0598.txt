Gaul, placing a diadem on his head, was invested, in the church of
St. Martin‚ with a purple tun-ic and mantle. From thence he pro-
ceeded on horseback to the cathedral of Tours3 and, as he passed
through the streets, profusely scattered‚ with his own hand, a dona-
tive of gold and filver to the joyful multitude, who inceflhntly re-
peated their acclamations of Cotficl and Augu us. The actual, or
legal authority of Clovis‚ could· not receive any new accessions from
the consular dignity, It was a name, a ssmdow, an empty pageant ;.
and, if the conqueror had been instructed to cl‘aim the ancient pre-
rogatives of that high office, they must have expired with the period
of its annual duration. But the Romans were disposed to revere,
in the person of their master, that antique title, which the emperors
condescended to assume: the Barbarian himself seemed t0·contra6t a
sacred obligation to respect the majesty of the republic 3, and the·
succeffors of Theodofius, by soliciting his friendlhip, tacitly forgave,
and almost ratified, the usurpation of Gaul.

Twenty-five years after the death of Clovis, this important con·-
ceffion was more foi-mally declared‚ in a treaty between his sons?
and the emperor Justinian. The Ostrogoths os Italy, unable to de-
fend their distant acquifitions, had refigned to the· Franks the cities of “
Arles and Marseilles: of Arles, still adorned with the seat of a
Praetorian praefec’c ; and of Marseilles, enriched by the advantages of-
trade and navigation ⁵⁸. This transaffion was confirmed by the

Imperial.
