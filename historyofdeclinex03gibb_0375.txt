OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE

of a fase and plentiful market on the banks of the Danube, they
required that, the annual contribution should be augmentet} from
three hundred and fifty, to seven hundred, pounds of gold 3 that a·
fine, or ransom, of eight pieces of gold, should be paid for every
Roman captive, who had escaped from his Barbarian masten
that the emperor should renounce all treaties and engagements
with the enemies of the Huns3 and that all the fugitivae, who
had taken refuge in the court, or provinces, of Theodosius, should
be delivered to the justice of their offended sovereign. This justice
was rigoroussy inflic'ted on some unfortunate youths of a royal nice.
They were crucified on the territories of the empire, by the command
of Attila: and, as soon as the king of the Huns had impreffed the
Romans with the terror of his name, he indulged them in a {hort

and arbitrary respite‚ whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent

nations of Scythia and Germany ⁴².

, Attila, the son of Mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his regal,
descent ⁵ from the ancient Huns, who had formerly contend‘ed with
the monarchs of China. His features, according to the observation
of a Gothic historiam, bore the stamp of his national origin; and the
portrait of Attila. exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern Cal-
muck ⁶3 a large· head, a swarthy complexion, small deep-seated eyes,
.a flat nofe„ a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad ssioulders, and
a {hort square body, of nervous strength, though of a disproportioned
⁷ form. The haughty step and demeanour of the king of the Huns exa
preffed the consciousness of his superiority above the rest'of mankind ς
