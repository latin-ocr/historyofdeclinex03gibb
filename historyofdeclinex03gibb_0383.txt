been obtained by treachery, served as a prelude to more honourable

and decifive victories. The Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of

castles and fortreffes; and though the greatest part of themt con-

fisted only of a single tower‚ with a small garrison, they were conr--
monly sufficient to repel‚ or to intercept, the inroads of an enemy„

who was ignorant of the art, and· impatient of the tle-lay, of 'a re*

the inundation of the Huns ¹⁹. > They destroyed, with fire arid sword,

the populous cities of Sirmium and Singidunum, of Ratiaria and

whole breadth. of Europe, as it extends above five hundred miles

from the Euxine to the Hadriatic‚ was at once invaded, and occu< s

i'nto the field. The public danger and distress could not, however,
provoke Theodosius to interrupt his amu-sements and devotion, or

and the progress of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle. The
