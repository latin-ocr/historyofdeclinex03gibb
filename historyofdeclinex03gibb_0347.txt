tion of the most sacred duty. Elated by the submlss' on of Italy, and4

the hope of an alliance with the Huns, John presumed to insult, by

— an embaffy, the majesty of the Eastern emperor; but When he un-‘

derstood that his agents had been banished, imprisone'd, and at length'
01130011 away with deserved ignominy, John prepared to affert, by
arms, the i11justlee of his 01311113. In such a cause, the grandson of
the great Theodofius should have marched 111 person: but the
young 0111Ρο101 was eafily diverted, by 1113 Ρ11γ11013113, from s‘o 13111

the conquest of Italy. Ardaburius employed, or abused, the 00111·-

11ἷο troops a sense of loyalty ancl gratitude3 and, 33 soon a's the con-⁴

credulity transformed into an angel, guided the Eastern cavalry by?
