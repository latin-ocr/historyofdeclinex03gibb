and more >arduous tafk on the genius of Majorian. Rome expedied-
from him alone the restitution of Africa; and the destgn, which he
formed, of attacking the Vandals in their new settlements, was the
result of bold and judicious policy. If the intrepid emperor could
have infused his own spirit into the youth of ltaly; if he could have
revived, in the field of Mars, the manly exercises in which he had
aiways surpafl'cd his equals3 he might have marched against Gen·-
scric, at the head of a Roman army. Such a reformation of
national manners might be embraced by the rising generation;
but it is the missortune of those princes who laborioussy sustain -a
declining monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate advantage, or
to avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance,
and even to multiply, >the most pernicious abuses. Major-ian, «like
the weakest of his predeceffors, was reduced to the disgraccful expe-
dient of substituting Barbarian auxiliaries in the <place of his unwar-
like subjecsts ι- and his superior abilities could only be displayed in the ·
vigour and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous instru-
ment, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it. Besldes the confe-
derates, who were already engaged in the service of the empire, the
fame of his liberality and valour attraaed the nations of the Da-
nube, the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the Tanais. Many thousands
of the bravest subje&s of Attila, the Gepidae, the Ostrogoths,‚ the
Rugians, the Burgundians‚ the Suevi, the Alani, affembled in ..the
plains of Liguria3 and their formidable strength was balanced by
their mutual animofitics⁴ ⁴.⁶ They paffed the Alps 111 a severe win-
