scended to promise, that, if Honorius would instantly relign the
purple, he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in
the peaceful exile of some remote issand ⁹². So desperate indeed
did the fituation of the son of Theodosius appear, to those who were
the best acquainted with his strength and resource& that Jovius and
Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamoussy
