incompatible with Christianity: the Salic law was again amended by
his sons3 and at length, under the reign -of Dagobert‚ the code
was revised and promulgated in its animal form, one hundred years
after the establilhment of the French monarehy. ‘Within the same
period, the customsofthe Ripuarians were transcribed and publissied3
and Charlemagne himself, the legissator of his age and country, had
accurately studied-the two national lawe, which still prevailed among

the Franks⁶⁷. The same care was extended to their vafl'als ; and

’the rude institutione of the Alemanni and Bavarians were diligently

compiled and ratified by the supreme authority of the Merovingian
kings. The Vffigoths and Bmguudiaw, whose conquests in Gaul
preceded those of the Franks, ihewed *less impatience to attain one
of the principal benefits of civilised society.. ¹Euric was the first of
the Gothic princes, *who expreffed in ‘writing the manners and

customs of his people3 and the composition of the Burgundian 'laws

*and regain t'he affe&ions‚ of their Gallie subjeets⁶⁸. vThus⁹ by a sm·-
gular coincidence‚‘ the Germans ftamed their 'artless institutione, at

a time when the elaborate system of Roman jurisprudence was finally

consummate'd. In the Salic lawe, and the Pandeets of Justinian‚ we,

fian. The former extended from the Car-
