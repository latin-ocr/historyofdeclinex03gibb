The generous mind of Count Boniface was tortured by the exqui-
site distrcss of beholding the ruin, which he had occasloned, and
whose rapid progr-ess he was unable to check. After the loss of a

battle, he retired into Hippo Regius; where he was immediately

«besieged by an enemy, who confidered him as the real bulwark of

Africa.

The maritime colony of Hippo ²⁵, about two hundred miles

westward of Carthage‚ had formerly acquired the distinguilhing epi-

thet of Regius, from the refidence of Numidian kings ; and some
remains of 'trade and populousness still adhere to the modern city,

which is known in Europe by the corrupted name of Bona. The '

military labours, and anxious reflections‚ of Count Bonffuce, were

alleviated by the edifying conversation of his friend St. Augustin ²⁷3

The old Hippo Regius was finally destroyed ⁷

by the Arabs in the seventh century; but a
new town, at the distance of two miles, was
built with the materials; and it contained& in
the fixteenth century, about three* hundred
families of industrious, but turbatim-it, ma-
nufafturers. The adjacent territory is re-
nowned for a pure air, a fertile soil, and
plenty of exquisite fruits.
