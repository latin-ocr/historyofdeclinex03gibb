THE DECLINE AND FALL

quished, the fierce and illiterate succeffors of Ulphilas. The *eon-
sciousness of their own superiority might have raised them above the
arts, and paflions, ofreligious warfare. Yet, instead of assuming such
honourable pride, the orthodox theologians were tempted‚ by the
affurance of impunity, to compose fiffions, which must be stigma-
tized with the epithet's of fraud and forgery. They ascribed their
own polemical works to the most venerable names of Christian anti-
quity: the charadiers of Athanafius and Augustin were aukwardly
personated by vigilius and his disciples¹¹²; and the famous creed,
which so clearly expounds the mysteries of the Trinity and the In-
carnaffion, is deduced‚ with strong probability, from this African
school ¹¹³. Even the Scriptures themselves were profaned by their
raih and sacrilegious hands. The memorable text, which afferts

the unity of the THREE who bear witness in heaven ¹¹⁴, is con· .

demned by the universal filence of the orthodox fathers, ancient

verfions, and authentic manuscripts¹ .

¹¹² Compare the two prefaces to the Dia-
logue of vigilius of Thapsus (p. 118, ¹¹9·
edit. Chiflet). He might amuse his learned
reader with an innocent fithom but the sub—
je& was too grave, and the Africans were
too ignorant.

¹¹³ The P. Qesnel started this opinion,
which has been favourably received. But
the three following truths, however surprismg
they may seem, are now universally acknow-
ledged (Gerard Voffius, tom. vi. p. 5¹6-
522. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. viii.
p. 667-671,). 1. St. Athanasius is not the
author of the creed which is so frequently
read in our churches. 2. It does not appear
to have existed, within a century after his
death. 3. It was originally composcd in the
Latin tongum, and, consequently‚ in theVlest-
ern provinces. Gennadius, patriarch of Con-
stantinople‚ was so much amazed by this ex—
traordinary compofition, that he frankly pro—
nounced it to be the work of a drunken man.
