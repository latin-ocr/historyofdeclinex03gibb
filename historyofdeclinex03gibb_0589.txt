OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The allegiance of his brother was already seduced ; and the obe-
dience of Godegesil, who joined the royal standard with the troops
of Ge'neva‚ more effectually promoted the success of the conspiracy.
While the Franks and Burgundians contended with equal valour, his
seasonable desertion decided the event of the battle; and as Gundo-
bald was faintly supported by the disaffeeted Gauls, he yielded to the
arins of Clovis‚ and hastily retreated from the field, which appears
to have been situate between Langres and Dijon. He distrusted the
strength of Dijon, a quadrangular fortress‚ encompassed by two
rivers,¹ and by a wall thirty feet high, and fifteen thick, with four
gates, and thirty-three towers⁴⁰: he abandoned to the pursuit of

Clovis the important cities of Lyons and Vienna3 and Gundobald
still fied with precipitation, till he had reached Avignon, at the

distance of two hundred and fifty miles from the field of battle.
A long siege, and an artful negociation, admonished the king of the
Franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise. He imposed
a tribute on the Burgundian prinoe, compelled him to pardon and
rexirard his brother's treachery, and proudly returned to his own
doininions, with the' spoils and captives of the southern provinces.
This splendid triumph was soon clouded by the intelligence‚ that
Gundobald had violated his recent obligations, and that the unfor-

· tunate Godegefil, who was left at Vienna with a gai-rison of five

thousand Franks⁴¹, had been besieged, surprised‚ and maffacred, by
his inhumari brother. Such an outrage might have exasperated the

his 'person and works may be found in Du· the dukes of Burgundy. Longuerue Descrip-
