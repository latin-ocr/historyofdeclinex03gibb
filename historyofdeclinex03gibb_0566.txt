THE DECLINE AND FALL

Leovigild, the Gothic monarch of Spain, descrved the respect of his

μην-ψ cncmies, and the lo've of his subjeils: the Catholics enjoyed a free

toleration, and his Arian synods attempted, without much success,
to reconcile their scruples by abolilhing the unpopular rite of a fl’-
cond baptism. His eldest son Hermenegild‚ who was invested by
his father with the royal diadem, and the fair principality of Boetica,
contraCted an honourable and orthodox alliance with a Merovingian
princess, the daughter of Sigebert king of Austrafia, and of the fa-
mous Brunechild. The beauteous Ingundis, who was no more than
thirteen years of age, was received, beloved, and persecuted‚ in the
Arian court of Toledo; and her religious constancy was alternately
affaulted with blandiihments and violence by Goisvintha‚ the Gothic
queen, who abused the double claim of maternal authority¹²⁶. In-
censed by her refistance, Goisvintha seized the Catholic princess by
her long hair, inhumanly dalhed her against the ground, kicked her
till she was covered with blood, and at last gave orders that ssie should
be stripped, and thrown into a bason, or filh—pond ¹²7. Love and
honour might excite Hermenegild to resent this injurious treatment
of his bride3 and he was gradually persuaded, that Ingundis suffered
for the cause of divine truth. Her tender complaints, and the weighty
arguments of Leander, archbishop of Seville‚ accomplished his con-
version3 and the heir of the Gothic monarchy was initiated in the
Nieene saith by the solemn rites of confirmation ¹²². The rash youth,

Mariana almost forgets that he is a Jesuit‚ to
assume the style and spirit ofa Roman claffic.
Ferreras, an industrious compilet, reviews
his fafts, and rectifies his chronology.

¹²⁶ Goisvintha succeffively married two
kings ofthe Visigoths: Athanigild, to whom
{he bore Brunechild, the mother of Ingun-
dis; and Leovigild, whose two sons, Her-
menegild and Recared, were the iss‘ue of a
former marriage.

¹²²³ The Catholics who admitted the bap-
tism of heredes, repeated the rite, or, as it
was afterwards styled, the sacrament of con-
firmation, to which they ascribed many mystic
and marvellous prerogativam, both vifible and μ
invifible. See Chardou, Hist. des Sacre-
