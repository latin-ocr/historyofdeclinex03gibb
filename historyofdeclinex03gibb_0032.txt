(ἶΧῘξῶἱΠθ “ answer is, that the Son was made out of nothing ²⁵.'' The he‘
μανψ rencs, of various denominations, subfisted in peace under the protection
of the Arians of Constantinople3 who endeavoured to secure the at·-
tachment of those obscure sectaries3 while they abused, with unre-
lenting severity, the victory which they had obtained over the fol-
lowers of the council of Nice. During the partial reigns of Con-
stantius and Valens, the feeble remnant of the Homoousians was
deprived of the public and private exercise of their religion3 and
it has been observed, in pathetic language, that the scattered flock
was left without a {hepher-d to wander on the mountains, or to. be

devoured by rapacious wolves ²⁶.

But, as their zeal, instead of being*
subdued, derived strength and vigour from oppreffion, they seized
the first momente of imperfect freedom, which they acquired by the·

death -of Valens, to for-m- themselves ¹into -a regular congregation,

ancient Greeks, were united by the ties of the stri&est friendshipss

They had cultivated, with equal ardour, the same liberal> studies in
