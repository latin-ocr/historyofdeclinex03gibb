OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 387

But the Roman alnbaffador was ignorant of the treacherou's design, (ῙῚῙΞἸᾸΙᾸΥΡ-

which had been concealed under “the mast< of the public saith. The xi-ssss'ss-ssa
surprise and satisfaction of Edecon, when he contemplated the gpdffiiacc-'V

splendour of Constantinople, had encouraged the interpreter Vigilius ffl{”1{,{g<{³}nst

κῖο procure for him a secret interview with the eunuch Chrysaphius4⁸‚ Attila. ’
who governed the emperor and the empire. After some previous
conversation, and a mutual oath of secrecy, the eunuch, who had
not, from his own feelings or experience, imbibed any exiilted no-
„tions of ‘ministerial virtue, ventured to propose the death of Attila,
Las an important service, by which Edecon might deserve a liberal
ssiare of the wealth and luxury which he admired. The ambaffador
'of the Huns listened to the tempting offer3 and profefi'ed, with ap-
parent zeal, his ,ability‚ as well as readiness, to execute the bloody
deed: the design wasbcommunicated to the master of the offices‚
and the devout Theodofius consented to the affaffination of his in-
vincible enemy. But this perfidious conspiracy was defeated by
the diffimulation, or the repentance‚ of Edecon3 and, though he
Γ might exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason‚ which he
