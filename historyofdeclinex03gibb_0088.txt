The zeal of the emperors was ex-
cited to vindicate their own honour, and that of the Deity: and the
temples of the Roman world were lhbverted, about fixty years after
the converfion of Constantine.

From the age of Numa, to the reign of Gratiam, the Romans
preserved the regular succeffion of the several colleges of the sacer-
dotal order ³. Fisteen PONT11³FS exercised their supremejmisdiffion
over all things, and persons, that were consecrated to the service of
the gods3 and the various questions which perpetually arose in a
loose and traditionary system, were submitted to the judgrnent of
their holy tribunal. Fifteen grave and learned AUGURS observed
the face of the beaveris, and prescribed the actions of heroes, accord-
ing to the ssight of birds. Fifteen keepers of the Sybilline books (their
name onINDECEMVIRs was derived from their number) occa-
fionally consulted the history of future, and, as it should seem, of
contingent, events. Six VESTALS devoted their virginity to the
guard of the sacred fire, and of the unknown pledges of the duration
of Rome3 which no mortal had been suffered to behold with im-
punity ⁴. Seven EPULos prepared the table of the godS‚ conduCted
the solemn proceflion, and regulated the ceremonies of the annual

ternus on the same subje& (de Errore Profan.

parci, nec fratri, et per amatam conjugem
gladium vindicem ducit, &c.

tairc I'hilosophique) justifies, and limits, these
intolerant laws hythe temporal reign of Je-
hnvah over the Jews. The attempt is laud-
able.

in Cicero (de Legibus, ii. 7, 8.)‚ Livy (i. κα),
Dionysius Halicarnaffenfis (l. ii. p. 119—129.

tom. i. p. 1—90.)‚ and Moyle (vol. i. p. 10—-
55.). The last is the work of an English
Whig, as well as ofa Roman antiquary.

4 These mystic, and perhaps imaginary,
symbols have given birth to various fables
and conjectures. It seems probable, that the
Palladium was a small statue (three cubits and
a half high) of Minerva, nith a lance and
distaff3 that it was usually inclosed in aseriu,
or barrel ς and that afimilar barrel was placed
by its fide, to disconcert curiosity, or sacri-
lege. See Mezeriac (Comment. sur les Epi-
tres d’Ovide, tom. i. p. 60—66.), and Lip-
ssus (tom. iii. p. 610. de Vesta, &a c. 10.)-
