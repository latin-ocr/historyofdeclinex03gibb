dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money3 k--sssua

and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal arts,
and decent manners, which adorn- or imitate the inestimable gifts of.
genius and virtue. The luxury of his palace and table was hospita-1

Italy3. he wasv twice invested with the consulship, and he obtained
the rank of patrician. These civil honours were not incompatible
with the·enjoyment of leisure and tranquillity3 his hours, according*
to the demands of pleasure *or reason„ were aocurately distributed by
a water—clock3 and this avarice of time may'be allowed to prove
the sense which Maximus entertained of his own happiness. The
injury which he received from the emperor Valentinian, appears to·
excuse the most bloody revenge. Yet a philosopher might have

throws much light on the character of Maxi- of consular rank.
