THE DECLINE AND FALL

Sophia, till his sister, by her tears and entreaties, could- obtain his

pardon from the indignant emperor, Heraclius effected his retreat
through the desert3 Marcellinus retired' to Sicily, where he was as-
saffinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own
captain33 and the king of the Vandals expreffed his surprise and sa'-
tisfaecion, that the Romans themselves should remove from the world
his most formidable antagonists ⁸⁹. After the failure of this great ex*-
pedition, Genseric again became the tyrant of the sea: the coasts of
Italy, Greece, and Asia, were again exposed to his revenge and
avarice3 Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his obedience·; he added
Sicily to the number of his provinces; and, before he died, in the

fulness of years and of glory, he beheld the final extindtion of the
empire of the West ⁹⁰.

During his long and active reign, the African monarch had stu-'
dioussy cultivated the friendlhip of the Barbarians of Europe, vvhose'
arms he might employ in a seasonable and effectual diverfion against
the two empires. After the death of Attila, he renewed his alliance'
with the Vifigoths of Gaul3 and the sons of the elder Theodoric,
who succeffively reigned over that war-like nation, were eafily per-¹
suaded, by the sense of interest, to forget the cruel affront which
Genseric had inflicted on their fister⁹¹ The death of the emperor

Majorian delivered Theodoric the second from the restraint of fear, and
perhaps of honour3 he violated his recent treaty with the Romans· 3⁹
