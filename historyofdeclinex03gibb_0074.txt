THE DECLINE AND FALL

unfortunate youth, without a struggle, and almost without a murmur,

from the administration‚ and even from the inheritance‚ of the em-.

pire. If Theodotius had consulted the rigid maxims of interest and
policyg his conclu& would have been justified by his friend53 but the
generosity of his behaviour on this memor-able occasion has extorted
the applause of his most inveterate enemies. He seated Valentinian
,on the throne of Milan3 and, without stipulating any present or
future advantages, restored him to the absolute dominion of all the
provinces, from which he had been driven by the arms of Nlaximus,
To the restitution of his ample paffimony, Theodosius added the free
and generous gift of the countries beyond the Alps, which his
successful valour had recovered from the affaffin of Gratiani ¹⁰¹.
Satisfied with the glory which he had acquired, by revenging
the death of his benefactor, and delivering the VJ est from the yoke
of tyranny‚ the emperor returned from Milan to Constantinople3
and, in the peaceful poffession of the East, insenfibly relapsed into
his former habits of luxury and indolence. Theodofius discharged

his obligation to the brother, he indulged his conjugal tenderness to

⁸the lister, of Valentinian: and posterity‚ which admires the pure

and singular glory of his elevation,. must applaud his unrivalled
generofity in the use of victory.

The empress Justina did not long survive her return to Italy3 and,
though she beheld the triumph of Theodosius, she was not allowed
to influence the government of her son ¹³⁰². The pernicious attach·
ment to the Arian sedi, which Valentinian had imbibed *from-her
example and instructions, was soon erased by the leffons of a more
orthodox education. His growing zeal for the faith of Nice, and
