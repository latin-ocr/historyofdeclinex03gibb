palaces of kings. Theodosius was chaste and temperate: he enjoycd, κῳ-γ--Α

without excels, the scnsual and social pleasures os the table 3 and the
warmth of his amorous pallions was never diverted from their lawful
obje&s. The proud titles os Imperial greatness were adorned by the
tender names of a faithful husband, an indulgent father3 his uncle
was raised, by his affcfftionate estcem, to the rink of a second pa-
rent: Theodosius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother
and sister5 and the expressions of his regard were extended to the
most distant and obscure branehes of his numerous kindred. His
familiar friends were judicioussy selected from among those persons,
who, in the equal intercourse of private life, had appeared before his
eyes without a mask: the consciousness of personal and superior
merit enabled him to despise the accidental distinffion of the purple3
and he proved by his conduct, that he had forgotten all the inju-
ries, while he most gratefully remembered all the favours rand
services, which he had received before he ascended the throne of
the Roman empire. The serious, or lively, tone of his conversation,
was adapted to the age, the rank, or the character, of his subjeE‘ts
whom he admitted into his society3 and the affability of his man—-
ners displayed the image of his mind. Theodosius respected the
fimplicity of the good and virtuous; every art, every talem, of an
useful, or even of an innocent, nature, was rewarded by his judi-
cious liberality3 and, except the heretics, whom he persecuted with
implacable hatred, the diffufive circle of his benevolence was cir·-
cumscribed only by the limits of the human race. The governmcnt
of a mighty empire may affuredly suffice to occupy the time, and

the abilities, of a mortal: yet the diligent prince, without aspiring
to the unsuitable reputation of profound learning, always reserved

some moments of his leisure for the instruffive amusement of read-

ing. History, which enlarged his experience, was his favourite
G 2 study.
