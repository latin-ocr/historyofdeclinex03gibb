ι--Ν army to his favourite Leo 3 two generals, who differently, but effec- 'l
tually, promoted the cause of the rebels. Leo ²⁶, who, from the
bulk of his body, and the dulness of his mind, was surnamed the
Ajax of the Rape, had desei-ted his original trade of a woolcomber,
to exercise, with much less skill and success, the military profeffion:
and his uncertain operations were capricioussy framed and executed,
w‘lth an ignorance of real difficulties, and a timorous negle& of

every favourable opportunity. The rassmess of the Ostrogoths had
drawn them into a disadvantageous pofition between the rivers
lNlelas and Eurymedon, where they were almost besieged by the
peasants of Pamphylia ; but the arrival of an Imperial army, instead Ἰ
of completing their destruction, afforded the means of safety and  
victory. Tribigild surprised the unguarded camp of the Romans, in j
the darkness of the night3 seduced the saith of the greater part ’
of the Barbarian auxiliaries, and diffipated, without much effort,
the troops, which had been corrupted by the relaxa-tion of disci·
pline, and the luxury of the capital. The discontent of Gaiam,
who had so boldly contrived and executed the death of Rufinus, was
irritated by the fortune of his unworthy sncceffor3 he accused his
own dissionourable *patience under the servile reign of an eunuch;
and the ambitious Goth was convi&ed‚ at·least in -the public opinion,
of secretly fomenting the revolt of Tribigild, with whom he was
c01ine6ted by a domestic, as well as by a national, alliance ²⁷. When
Gainas pass'ed the Hellespont‚ to un'ite under his standard the remains
of the Afiatie troops, he sszilfully adapted his motions to the wishes
of the Ostrogoths3 abandoning, by his retreat, the country which
