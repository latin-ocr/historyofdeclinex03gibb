t--v-J with her two daughters, the only surviving remains of the great

Theodofius, was compelled, as a captive, to follow the haughty Van- =
dal} who immediately hoisted fail, and returned With a prosperous
navigation to the port of Carthage ⁹. Many thousand Romans of
both sexes, chosen for some useful or agreeable qualifications, relue-
rantly enillarked on board the sseet of Genseric3 and their distress
was aggravated by the unfeeling Barbarians, who, in the division of ⁷
the boo-ty, separated the wives from their husbands, and the children-s
from their parents. The charity of Deografias, bissmp of Carthage¹⁰‚2
was their only consolation and* support. He generoussy sold the·
gold and filver plate of the church to purch-ase the freedom of some„
to alleviare the ssavery of others, and to affist the wants and infir-
mities of 'a captive multitude, whose health was impaired by the*
hardships which they had suffered in the passage from Italy to-
Africa. By his order, two spacious churches were converted into
hospitals : the fickwere ‹distributed in convenient beds, and liberall}⁴

supplied With food and medicines3 and the· aged prelate repeated·
his vifits both in the day and night, with an affiduity that surpaffed
his strength„ and a tender sympathy which enhanced the value of ⁴
his services. Compare this scene with the field of Cannae3 ands.

fleet that suffered fhipwreclz. If a bigotted
sophist‚ a Pagan bigot, had mentioned the
accident, he might have rejoicetL that this
<argo of sacrilege was lost in the sea.
