OF THE ROMAN EMPIR'E. 617

South, till their victorious banners were united in the centre of the {JXQI}
issand. chond the Severn the Britons still afferted their national k--v-——J

sreedom, which survived the heptarchy‚ and even the monarchy, of
the Saxona. The bravest warriors, who preferred exile to ssavery,
found a secure refuge in the mountains of Vsales: the remitant
‘submiffion of Cornwall was delayed for some ages¹³⁵ 3 and a band of
fugitives acquired a settlement in Gaul, by their own valour, or the
liberality of the 'Nlerovingian kings ¹³⁶. The W estern angle of Ar-
morica acquired the new appellations of Cornwczll, and the Lff’r
Britain ; and the vacant lands of the Ofismii were filled by a strange
people‚ who, under the authority of their counts and bishops, pre—
served the laws and language of their ancestors. To the feeble
descendants of Clovis and Charlemagne‚ the Britons of Armorica
refused the customary tribute, subdued the neighbouring dioceses of
Vannes, Rennes, and Nantes, and formed a powerful, though vaffal,

state, which has been united to the crowp of France .

¹³⁵ Cornwallwas finally subdued by Athel- o'frhe fifth century. Beyond that aera, the
stan (A. D. 927—941.)‚ who planted an Britons of Armorica can be found only in

Engliih colony at Exeter, and confined the
Britons beyond the river Tamar. See Wil-
liam of Malmsbury, l. ii. in the Scriptores
post Bedam, p. 50. The spirit ofthe Cornish
knights was degraded by servitude; and it
should soem, from the romanceof Sir Tris-
tram‚ that their cowardice was almost pro-

verbial. .

¹³⁶ The establisszment of the Britons in
Gaul is proved in the fixth century, by Pro—
copius, Gregory of Tours, the second council
of Tours (A. D. 567.), and the least suspi-
>cious of their clironicles and lives of saints.
'Phe subscription of a bishop of the Britons
to the first council ofvTours (A. D. 461. or
rather481.), the army ofRiofflamus, and the
loose declamation of Gildas(alii transmarinas
petebant regiones, c. 23. p. 8.), may counte-
mance an emigration as early as the middle

romance; and I am surprised that Mr. Whit-
aker (Genuine History of the Erimus, p.

· 214—221.) should so faithfully transcribe the

gross ignorance of Cane, who'se venial er-
rors he has so rigoroussy chastised.

²³⁷ The antiquities of Bretagne, which
have been the subja& even of politica] con-
troversy, are illustrated by Hadrian Valesius
(Notitia Galliarum, sub voce Britannia Cisl
marina, p. 98—100.), M. d’Anville (Notice
del’Ancienne Gaule, Corifhpiti, Curiofhliles,
Osistnii, Vmganium, p. 248. 258. 508. 720.
and Etats de l'Europe, p.76-80.)‚ Longue-
rue (Description de la France, tom. i. p.

’ἐὴ-ρῳ), and the Abbe de Vertot (Hist-

Critique de l'Etabliss‘ement des 'Bretons dans
les Gaules, 2 vol. in 1zrno. Paris, 1720.).
I may assume the merit of examining the ori-⁴

,ginal evidence which they have produced.
