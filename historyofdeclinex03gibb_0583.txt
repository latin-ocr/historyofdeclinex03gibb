of an hostile territory: but his subjeos of Gaul enjoyed the 'free ι--ν--θ

exercise of religious worship ; and the bishops entertained a more fa·-
vourable hope of the idolater‚ than of the heretics. The Merovingian
prince had contracted a fortunate alliance with the fair Clotilda‚ the
niece of the king of Burgundy, who, in the midst of an Arian
court, was edueated in the profeffion of the Catholic faith. It was.>
her interest, as well-A as her duty, to at'chieve »the converfion ²⁶ of a
Pagan husband ς and Clovis insenfibly listened to the voice of love
and religion. He consented, (perhaps such terms had been previoussy
stipulated) to the baptism of his eldest son3 and though the sudden
death of the infant excited some superstitious fears, he was persuaded,
a second time, to repeat the dangerous experiment. In the distress
of the battle of Tolbiac, Clovis loudly invoked the god of Clotilda
and the Christians ; and victory disposed him to hear, with respectful-
gratitude‚ the eloquent ²⁷ Remigius ²⁸, bishop of Rheims‚ who foreibly

displayed the tempora] and spiritual advantages of his converfion.
“ The king dedared himself satisfied of the truth of the cathonc
faith; and the political reasons which might have suspended his·

and Rome. The fa& is incredible, and the
mistake only fhews how completely, in less
than a century, the narional religion of the
Franks had been abolished, and even for—

²⁶ Gregory of Tours relates thetmari-inge
and converslon of Clovis (l. ii. c. 28—31. in
tom. ii. p. 175—178.). Even Fredegarius,
or the nameless Epitomizer (in tom. ii. p.
398—400.), the author of the Gesta Fran-
, c'orum (in torn.ii. p. 548-552.), andAimoin
himself (Li. c. ¹3- in tom. iii. p. 37—40.),
may be heard without disdain. Tradition
might long preserve some carious circum-
stances of these important transactions.
’Π Α traveller, who returned from Rheims
tn Auvergne, had stolen a copy of his Decla-

mations from the secretary or bookseller of·
the modest archbishop (Sidonius Apollinar-
l. ix.. epist. 7.). Four epistles of Remigius5
which are still extant (in tom. iv. p. 51, 52,

53.), do not correspond with the splendid
praife of Sidonius.

²⁸ Hincmar, one of the succeffors of Re«
migius (A. D. 845·-882.)‚ has composed hist
life (in tom. iii. p. 373—380.).› The autho-
rity osancient MSS. of the church of Rheims=
might inspire some confidence, wh‘ich is de:-
stroyed, however, by the selfish and audacious
fi‘stions of Hincmar. Itis remarkable enough,.
that RemigiuS, who was consecrated at the
age of twenty-two (A. D. 457.)‚ filled the·
episcopal chair seventy-four years (Pagi Cri·—
tica, inBaromtom. ii. p,- 384. 57¹2).
