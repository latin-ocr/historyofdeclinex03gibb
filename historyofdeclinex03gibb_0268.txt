The personal animofities, and hereditary feuds, of the Barbarians‚
were suspended by the strong neceffity of their affairs 3 and the brave
Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarch, was una-
nimoussy elected to sueceed to his throne. The character and po-
litical system of the new king of the Goths‚ may be best understood
from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne;
who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the HolyLand, related it to St. Je-
rom, in the presence of the historian Orofius. ‘⁶ In the full confi-
“ dence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to
‘⁶ change the face of the universe ; to obliterate the name of Rome3 .
“ to ere& on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire,
‘⁶ like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire-
“ By repeated experiments, I was gradually convinced, that laws
“ are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well-constituted ’
“ state3 and that the fierce untratstable humour of the Goths was
“ incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws, and civil govern-
“ ment. From that moment Ι proposed to myself a different obje& -

“ gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit ¹of a stran-

“ to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the Roman empire ¹²⁹.’'

operations of war3 and serioussy negociated with the Imperial court
a treaty of friendssiip and alliance. It was the interest of the mini-
sters of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of
their extravagant oath, to deliver Italy from the intolerable weight
