OF THE ROMANEMPIRE. 533

Christian Barbariana, maintaIned a 'filent intercourse between the stgxih}
reign of Augustus, and the times of Clovis and Charlemagne. The b—-v--d
einirlation of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a
more perfect state ; and the flame of science was secretly kept alive, to
warni and enlighten the mature age of the XVestern world. In the
most corrupt state of Christianity, the Barbarians might leam justice
from the law, and mercy from the gospel .· and if the knowledge of
their duty wzis insufficient ῐο, guide their actions, or to regulate their
passions; they were sometimes restrained by conscience, and frequently
punissred by remorsa But the dire& authority of religion was less
effectual, than the holy communion which united them with their
Christian brethren in spiritual friendship. The influence of these

sentiments contributed to secure their fidelity in the service, or the
assiance, of the Romans, to alleviare the horrors of war, to moderate*
the insolence of conquest,> and to preserve, in the downfall of the
empire, a permanent respect for thc name and institutions of Rome.›
In the days of Paganisnr, the priests of Gaul* and Germany ,reigned
over the peopleJ and controuled the jurisdiction of the magistratesg.
and the -zealous proselytes transferred ,an eqrial, or more ample„ mea—-
sure* of devout obedience, to> the pontiffs of the Christian faith. ¹ The
sacred character of the bishops was* supported by their tempor-al
poffeffi01133 they obtained an honourable seat in the legissative assem·
bl-ies of soldiers.and freemen3 and it was their interest, as wellas
, their: duty, to mollify‚ by peaceful- counsels, the fierce spirit of the
Barbarianffi The perpetual correspondence of the. Latin clergy, the
&equent pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, and the growing au·-⁴
'thority of the Popes‚ cernented the union of the Christian‘republicz.
a'u‘sd gradually produced the fimilar manners, and common jurispruo
dence, which have distinguished, from the rest of mankind, the
independentg, and even hostile, nations of modern Europe.
