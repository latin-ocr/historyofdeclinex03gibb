328 THE DECLINE AND FALL

ΟΧῙΞΞΧΫΠῩ· ambition: he extorted the title of Augustus; and the servant of
(nv-*J Honorius was associated to the empire of the West. The death of
Constantius, in the seventh month of his reign, instead of diminilh-
ing, seemed to increase, the power of Placidia3 and the indecem
familiarity ² of her brother, which might be no more than the symp-
toms of a ehildish affection, were universally attributed to incestuous

love. On a sudden, by some base intrigues of a steward and a nurse,
this excellive fondness was converted into an irreconcileable quarrel:
the debates of the emperor and his slster were not long confined
within the walls of the palace3 and as the Gothic soldiers·adhered
to their queen, the city of Ravenna was agitated with bloody and
danger-ons tumults‚ which could only be appeased by the forced or
voluntary retreat of Placidia and her children. The royal exiles
landed at Constantinople, soon after the marriage of Theodosius,
during the festival of the Perfian victories. They were treated with
kindness and magnificence3 but as the statues of the emperor Con-
stantius had been reje&ed by the Eastern court, the title of Augusta
could not decently be allowed to his widow. Within ajew months
after the arrival of placidia, a swift mefl'enger announced the death
of Honorius, the consequence of a dropsy; but the important secret
was not divulged, till the necessary orders had been dispatched for
the march of a large body of troops to the sea-coast of Dalmatia„
The lhops and the gates of Constantinople remained {hut during seven
days3 and the loss of a foreign prince, who could neither be esteemed
nor regretted, was celebrated with loud and affeeted demonstrations
‚of the public grief.
