and dangerous enterprise. In the tumultuous capital of Egypt, the
ssightest provocation was sufficient to inflame a civil war· The vota-
ries of Serapis, whose strength and numbers were much inferior to
those oftheir antagonists, rose in arms at the instigation ofthe philoso-
pher Olympius ⁴⁵, who exhorted them to die in the defence of the
altars of the gods. These Pagan fanatics fortified themselves in the

temple, or rather fortress, of Serapis ; repelled the besiegers by daring
sdllies, and a resolute defence ; and, by the inhuman c'ruelties which
they exercised on their Christian prisonem, obtained the last conso-
lation of despair. The efforts of the prudent magistrate were usefully
exerted for the establishment of a truce, till the answer of Theodo-
slus should determine the fate of Serapis. The two parties affembled3
without arms, in the principa? sc'luare3 and the Imperial rescript was
publicly read. But when a sentence of destruction against the idol's

and exustafion, whilst the unfortunate Pagans, whose fury had given.

by their ssight or obscursty, the resentmcnt of their enemies.. The-
ophilus proceeded to demolissi the temple of Serapis, with-out any

in honour of the Christian mart-yrs. The valuable library of Alex-
