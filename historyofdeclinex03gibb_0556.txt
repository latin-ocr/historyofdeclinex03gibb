A general
view of the
persecution
in Africa.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

Belisarius3 and the orthodox party retaliated the injuries ‘which they

had endured ⁸⁹.

The paflionate declamatione, of the Catholies, the sole historians of
this persecution‚ cannot afford any distin& series of causes and eventsg
any impartial view of characters, or counsels3 but the most remark-⁴
able circumstances, that deserve either credit or notice, may be re-
ferred to the following heads: I. In the original law, which is stili
extant ⁹⁰, Hunneric expressly declares, and the declaration appears to
be correct, that he had faithfully-transcribed the regulations and
penalties of the Imperial edict& *against the heretical congregation85
the clergy‚ and the people‚ who· diffented from the established reli-
gion. If the rights of conscience had been understood, the Catholics
must have condemned their past conduct, or acquiesced in their actual
sufferings. But they still perfisted to refuse the indulgence which
they claimed. While they trembled under the lash of persecution3
they praised the laudable severity of Hunnerie himself, who -burnt or
banished greatvnumbers of Manichaeans ³¹3 and they rejecfited, with
horror, the ignominious compromise‚ that the disciples of Arius,
and of Athanasius, should enjoy a reciproeal and similar toleration

in the territories of the Romans, and in those of the Vandals⁹-².

³⁹ The original monuments ofthe Vandal
persecution are preserved in the five books of
the History ofVie'tor Vitenfis (de Persecutione
Vandalicfi), a bishop who was exiled by Hun-
neric3 in the Life of St. Fulgentius, who was
distinguished in the persecution of Thrafi-
mond (in Biblioth. Max. Panum, tom. ix.

p. 4—16.), and in the first book of the Van· .

dalic War, by the impartial Procopius (c. 7,
8. p. 196, 197, 198, ¹99·)· Dom Rui-
nart, the last editor of Victor, has illustr-ared
the whole subject with a copious and learned
apparatus of notes and supplement (Paris,
ὥρῳ). .

'²’ Victor. iv. 2. p. 65. Hunneric refuses

the name of Catholiss to the Homoou ans.
He describes, as> the veri Divin'ae Majestatis
cultores, his own> party, who profeffed tlte
saith, confirmed by more than a thousand
bisbops, in the synods of Rimini and Se·-
leucia, ·
⁹¹ Victor. ii. 1. p. 21, 22. Laudabilior
. . videbatur. In the MSS. which-omit
this word, the passage is unintelligible. See
Ruinart. Not. p. 164.

⁹² Victor. ii. 2. p. 22, 23. The clergy
of Carthage called these condixions, pericu-
Iqsae3 and they seem, indeed, to have been
proposed as a snare to enti-ap the Catholxc
bilhops⁴
