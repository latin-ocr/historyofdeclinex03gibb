and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into a formidable
conspiracy. The people of Aquitain was alarmecl by the indiscreet
reproaches of their Gothic tyrants‚ who justly accused them of pre-
ferring the dominion of the Franks; and their zealous adherent
Qinfianus, bissiop of Rodez ⁴²³, preached more forcibly in his exile
than in his diocese. To refist these foreign and domestic enemies5
who were fortified by the alliance of the Burgundians,· Alaric col-“-
leded his troops, far more numerous than the military powers of
Clovis.: - The Vifigoths resumed the exercise of arms, which they

cities of Gaul were compelled to furnish their doubtful and re‘-

lucrant aid. -Th'eodorio,r king of the Ostrogoths, who reigned in
Italy, had laboured to maintain the tranquillity of Gaul3 and he
affumed', or affeered for that purpose, the‘impartialcl1ara6ter of a

Clovis‚ and he was fnmly engaged to support the national and re-

ligious cause of the Goths..

use, of 111151 weapon3 are clearly described by
Procopius (intom. ii. p.. 3²7.) Examples of
its natIonal appellationi in Latin and French,
may be found in the Gloffary of Ducange,
and the large Diffionnaire de Trevoux.

in a life of Qindanus, composed' in rhyme
in the old Patois of Rouergue (Dubos Hist‘·
