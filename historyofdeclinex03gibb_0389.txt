he became the ssave of Onegefius; but his faithful services, against
the Romans and the Acatzires, had gradually raised him to the rank

service. This refledlion naturally produced a dispute on 'the advan-
tages‚ and defe&s‚ of the Roman government‚ which was severely
’ arraigned by the apostate, and defended by Priscus in a prolix and
feeble declamation. The freedman of Onegefius exposed, in true
and lively colours‚ the vices of a declining empire, of which he had
so long been the victim ; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes,
unable to prote& their subjefizs against the public enemy, unwilling

weight of taxes, rendered still more oppreflive by the intricate or
arbitrary modes of collecti0n3 the obscurity of numerous and con-

ceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the universal
corruption, which increased the influence of the rich, and aggravated
the misfortunes of the poor. A sentiment of patriotic sympathy was
at³ length revived in the breast of the fortunate exile; and he la-

strates‚ who had perverted the wisest and most salutary institu-
tions ³².
