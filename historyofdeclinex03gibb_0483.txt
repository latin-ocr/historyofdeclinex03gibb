*OF >THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

eriminate his nominal reign in the vacant interval of slx years, be-
tween the death of Majorian, and the elevation of Anthemius.
During that period the government was in the hands of Ricimer
alone3 and although the modest Barbarian diselaimed the name of
king, he accumulated treasures, formed a separate army, negociated
private alliances, and ruled Italy with the same independent and de-
spotic authority, which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and
Theodoric. But his dominions were bounded by the Alps; and two
Roman generals, Marcellinus and AEgidius‚ maintained theiralle-
giance to the republic‚ by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom
which he styled an emperor. Marcellinus still adhered to the oid
religion ; and the devout Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws

vulfions of the Western empire. His voluntary, or reluatant, sub-
miflion, to the authority of Majorian, was rewarded by the govern-

issand to oppose, or to attack‚ the Vandals; but his Barbarian mer-
cenaries, after the emperor’s death, were tempted to revolt by the
artful liberality of Ricimerss At the head of a b'and of faithful fol-
lowers, the intrepid Marcellinus occupied the province of Dalmatia,
affumed the title of patrician of the &Vest‚ secured the love of his
subjedts by a mild and equitable reign, built a fleet, which claimed
the dominion of the Hadriane, and alternately alarmed the coasts of
