OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

mourniug, the Eastern emperor was interrupted by the arrival of the
principal chamberlain of Maximus: and the choice of a venerable
old man, for an office which was usually exercised by eunuchs, an-
nounced to the court of Constantinople the gravity and temperance
of the Britilh usurper. The ambaffador condescended to justify, or
excuse, the conduct of his master3 and to protest, in specious lan-
