ι-..Ὴ Theodosius, and of Galla, his second wife, had received a royal'

education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of
her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the Western
empire under the reign of her brother Honorius. When Rome was
first invested by the arms of Alaric‚ Placidia, who was then about
twenty years of age, relided in the city; and her ready confent'to
the death of her cousin Serena, has a cruel and ungrateful appearance,
which, according to the circumstances of the aetion, may be aggra-
vated‚ or excused, by the confideration of her tender age ¹³³. The
victorious Barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive ¹³⁴, the
sister of Honorius; but, while she was exposed to the disgrace ofi
following round Italy the motions of a Gothic camp, she experienced,
however, a decent and respeE'tful treatment. The authority of Jor-
nandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counter-
balanced by the filence, the expreffive filence, of her flatterers: yet
the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of man-
ners, and the dexterous infinuation which ihe condescended to em-
ploy, made a deep impreffion on the mind of Adolphus; and the
Gothic king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor. The
ministers of Honorius reje&ed witlr disdain the propos-al of an al·-
liance, so injurious to every sentiment of Roman pride3 and repeat-
edly urged the restitution of Placidia, as an indispensable condition
of the treaty of peace. But the daughter of Theodofius submitted,
without reluctance, to the defires of the conqueror, a young and
valiant prince, who yielded to Alaric in loftiness of stature, but who

excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty. The
