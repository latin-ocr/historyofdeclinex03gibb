THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H Α P. army of Theodosius was iheltered by their pofition from the impe-

xxx‘lf.

swas-...e tuofity of the wind, which blew a cloud of dust in the faces of the

enemy, disordered their ranks, wrested their weapons from their
hands, and diverted‚ oi· repelled, their ineffeCIual javelins. This

accidental advantage was skilfully improved ; the violence of the storrn

was magnified by the superstitious terrors of the Gauls; and they
yielded without [haine to the invifible powers of heaven, who seemed
to militate on the side of the pious emperor. His vic‘tory was de-
cilive; and the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by
the difference of their chat-aerem. The rhetorician Eugenius, who
had almost acquired the dominion of the world, was reduced to
implore the mercy of the conqueror3 and the unrelenting soldiers
separated his head from his body, as he lay prostrate at the feet of
Theodosius. Arbogastes, after the loss of a battle, in which he had
discharged the duties of a soldier and a general, wandered several
days among the mountains. But when he was convinced, that his
cause was desperate, and his escape impra&icable, the intrepid Bar*-
barian imitated the example of the ancient Romans, and tui-ned his
sword against his own breast. The sate of the empire was deter-
mined in a narrow corner of Italy; and the legitimare successor of
the house of Valentinian embraced the archbiihop of Milan, and
gracioussy received the submiffion of the provinces of the West.
Those provinces were involved in the guilt of rebelli0n3 while the
inflexible courage of Ambrose alone had refisted the elaims of success-
ful usurpation. With a manly freedom, which might have b'een
fatal to any other subje&‚ the archbishop rejected the gifts of Euge·
nius, declined his correspondence, and withdrew himself from Milan,
to avoid the odious presence of a tyrant ; whose downfal he prediflted

in disci-eet and ambiguous language. The merit of Ambrose was

applaudcd by the conqueror, who secured the attachment of the
peoplc by his alliance with the church: and the clemency of Theo-
