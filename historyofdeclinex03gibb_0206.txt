cantation to the offended praefec‘t. He deplores, in mournsul strains,
the fatal indiscretion into vzhich he had been hurried by pafiion
and folly; submits to the imitation of his adversary, the generous
examples of the clemency of gods, of heroes, and of lions; and
expresses his hope, that the magnanimity of Hadrian will not trample
on a defenceless and contemptible soe, already humbled by disgrace
and poverty3 and deeply wounded by the exile, the tortures, and
the death of his dearest friends ¹¹⁶. XVhatever might be the success
of his prayer, or the accidents of his future life, the period of a few
years lcvelled in the grave the minister and the poet : but the name·
of Hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion‚ while Claudiam is read with
plcasure in every country which has retained, or acquir-cd, the know-
ledge of the Latin language. If We fairly balance his merits and his
defens, we shall acknovvledge, that Claudiam does not either satisfy,
or filence, our reason. It would not be easy to produce a passage
that deserves the epithet of sublime or pathetic ς’ to select a verse,
that melts ⁴the beart, or enlarges the imagination. We should vainly ’ 0
seek, in the poems of Claudiam, the happy invention, and artificial
cohduet, of an interesting fable3 or the just and lively representation
of the characters and situations of real life. For the service of his· l
patron, he publissied occafional panegyrics and invedfives: and the.
‹lefign of these ssavish compofitions encouraged his propenfity to ex·-
ceed the limits of truth and nature. These imperfections, however,
are compensated in sorne- degree by the poetical virtues of Claudian.
He was endovved with the rare and precious talent of raifing the
meanest, of adorning the most barren, and of diverfifying the most

fimilar, topics: his colouring‚ more especially in descriptive poetry,

betrays his secret reluaance.
