226 THE DECLINE AND FALL

k--v-——d po‘le ffion of Noricum, an exhausted and impoverished country,
perpetually exposed to the inroads of the Barbarians of Germany⁸⁸.
But the hopes of peace were (lisappointed by the weak obstinacy, or
interested views, of the minister Olympius. Without listening to
the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambaffa-
dors under the conda& of a military escort, too numerous for a re-

tinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence. Six'
thousand Dalmatians, the flower of the Imperial legions, were or-
dered to march from Ravenna to Rome, through an open country,
which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the Barbarians.
These brave legionaries‚ encompaffed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice
to ministerial folly3 their general Valens, with an hundred soldiers,
escaped from the field of battle3 and one of the ambaffadors, who
could no longer claim the protectior} of the law of nations‚ was
obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty thousand
pieces of gold. Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this a& of impotent
hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace: and the second
embaffy of the Roman senate, which derived weight and dignity
from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded
from the dangers of the road by a detachr‘nent of Gothic sol-
diers ⁸².
