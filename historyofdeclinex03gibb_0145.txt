t3he Augustan, legionS5 of the IVervian auxiliarie35 of the soldiers, m

who displaycd in their banners the symbol of a lion, and of the troops
which were distinguished by the auspicious names of Fortunate, and
Invincible. Yet such was the smallness of their establissnnents, or
the difficulty of 1·ecr11iting‚ that these stven hands ⁴⁴, of high dignity
and reputation in the service of Rome, amounted to no more than

five thousand effective men ⁴⁵. The fieet of gallies and transports

sailed in tempestuous weather from the port of Pisa, in Tuscany,

andsteered their course to the little issand of Capraria3 which had
borrowed that name from the wild goats‚ its original inhabitants,
whose place wan now occupied by a new colony of a strange and
savage appearance. “ The whole issand (says an ingenious traveller

“ of those times) is filled, or rather defiled, by men, who fly

.“ from the light. They call themselves Monks, or solstaries, because·
“ they chuse to live alone, without any witneffes of their actions..
‘³‘ They sear the gifts of fortune, from the apprehension of lofing them 3v

‘⁴ and, lest they should be miser-able, they embrace a life ·0f volun-
⁷“ tary wretchedness. How absurd is their ehoice l how perverse their
‘⁶ understanding l·v to dread the evils,v without being able to support
“ the bleffings, ¹of the human condition. Either this melancholy
“ madness is the effe& of disease‚ or else the consciousness of guilt
.“ urges these unhappy men to exercise on their own bodies the tor-

3“ tures which are i'nflicsted on fugitive ssaves by the hand of justice ⁴⁶.''‘

⁴4 Claudian, Bell. Gild. 415—423. The
change of discipline allowed him to use indif-
ferently the names of Legio, Cohors, Manipulus.
See the Notitia Imperii, S. 38. 40.

⁴⁵ Orosius (l. vii. c. 36. p. 565.) qualifies
this account with an expreffion of doubt (ut
aiunt); and it scarcely coincides with the
>magam αὸρας of Zofimus (l. v. p. 303.). Yet
Claudian, after some declamation about Cad-
musffs soldiers‚ srankly owns, that Stilicho
sent a small army ς lest the rebel should fly,

ne timeare times (i Cons. Stilich. 1.. i.

3⁴14, &c.).

4⁶ Claud. Rutil. Namatian. Itinerar. ἲ.
439—448. He afterwards (515 η-ς26.)ῐιί<εη-
tions a religious madman on the isse of Gor-

gona. For* such profane remarks, Rutilius‚.

and his accomplioes, are styled, by his com-

mentator, Barthius‚ rabiofi canes diaboli..
Tillemont (Mem. ·Eccles. tom. xii. p. 47¹·)=
inore calmly observes, that the unbelieving¹

poet praises where he means to›censure.
