neral might always command the armies of Rome3 and the name
of the minister was branded With ridicule, more pernicious perhaps
than hatred, to a public charadler. The subjects of Arcadius were
exasperated by the recollectiorn that this deformed and decrepid
eunuch ⁶, who so perversely mimicked the aetions of a man, was
born in the most abje& condition of servitude3 that, before he cn-
tered the Imperial palace, he had becn succeffively sold, and pur-
chased, by an hundred masters, who had exhausted his youthful
strength in every mean and infamous office, and at length dismiffed

him, in his old age, to freedom and poverty ⁷. While these dis-

graceful stories were circulated, and perhaps exaggerated‚ in private·-

conversations, the vanity of the favourite was flattered With the most

extraordinary honours. In the senate, in th'e capital, in the pro-

vinces, the statues of Eutropius were eredffd, in brass or mai-hle,

which Claudian more particularly describes,

were these: 1. He spent many years as the*

the Imperial stable‘s. 2. Ptolemy gave him to
the old general Arintheus, for whom he very

daughter of Arintheus ; and the future con-
