OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

pursue the revolutions of a Roman province, till it vanishes from
his fight 3 and an Englissiman may curioussy trace the establiffiment
of the Barbarians, from whom he derives his name, his laws, and per-
haps his origin.

About forty years after the diffolution of the Roman government‚
Vortigern appears to have obtained the supreme, though precarious‚
command of the princes and cities of Britain. That unfortunate
monarch has been almost unanimoussy condemned for the weak and
mischievous policy of inviting¹²³ a formidable stranger, to repel the
vexatious inroads of a domestic foe. His ambassadors are dispatched,
by the gravest historiam, to the coast of Germany3 they address a

pathetic oration to the general affembly of the Saxons, and those
warlike Barbarians resolve to affist with a fieet and army the suppliants

-of a distant and unknown issand. If Britain had indeed been unknown
to the Saxops, the measure of its calamities would have been less com-
·plete. But the strength of the Roman government could not always
guard the maritime province against the pirates of Germany: the
independent and divided states were exposed to their attacks; and the
“Saxons might sometimes join the Scots and the pins, in a tacit, or
express, confederacy of rapine and destruction. Vortigern could
only balance the various perils, which affaulted on every fide his
throne and his people ; and his policy may deserve either praise or
excuse, if he preferred the alliance of thqfi’ Barbarians, whose naval
power rendered them the most dangerous enemies, and the most ser-
viceable allies. Hengist and Horsa‚ as they ranged along the Eastern

coast with three ships, were engaged, by the promise of an ample
stipend, to embrace the defence of Britain 3 and their intrepid valour

¹²⁸ This invitation, which may dei-ive some even Hume, have too freely used this suspi-
-countenance from the loose expreffions of cious evidence, without regarding the pre-
Gildas and Bede, is framed into a regular eise and probable testimony of Nennius :v
story by Witikind, a Saxon monk of the Interea venerunt tres Chiulae a Germania in
tenth century (see Coufin, Hist. de l’Empire exilio pulsae, in quibus erant Hors et Hengist.
