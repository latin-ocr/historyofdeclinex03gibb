oF THE· ROMAN EM'PIRE: 33:32-

Africa, attest the military talents of count Boniface„ In the field of (ἷΧξζῙΧΫΠΡ
battle, in partial encounters‚ in single comhats, he was still the terror ι--γ--ι
of the Barbarians ι the clergy, and particularly his friend Augustin,.
were ediiied by the Christian piety, which had once tempted him too
retire from the world3 the people applauded his spotless integrity 3,
the army dreaded his equal and inexorable justice, which may be·¹
displayed in a very singular example. A peasant‚ who complained'·
of the criminal intimacy between his wife and a Gothic soldier, was
dire&ed to attend his tribunal the following day: in the evening the*
count, who* had diligently informed himself of the time and place
of the affignation‚ mounted his horse, rode ten miles into the couri--
try, surprised the guilty couple‚ punissied the soldier with instant
death, and filenced the complaints of the husband‚. by presenting him,
ᾡς next morning, with* the head of the adulterer... The abilities ρξ’
AEtius and Boniface might have been usefully employed against thet
public enemies, in separate and important commanda ς, but the ssKPe*
rience of their past conduct should have decided the real favour anti¹
epnfidence ,of the empress Placidia. In the melancholy season of her-¹
γ exile and disti-ess, Boniface alone had maintained her cause with un-r-
ihaken fidelity3 and the troops and treasures of Africa had effentially
contributed to extinguish the rebellion. The same rebell'ion had?
been supported by the zeal and activity of AEtius, who brought an2
army of fixty thousand Huns‘ from the Danube to the confines οἱ
Italy, for the service of the usurper. The untimely death of 'Johnffi
epinpelled him to¹ accept an advantageous treaty32 but he still conti*
nued, the subjeci and the soldier of Valentinian, to entertai'n a secret„
perhaps a· treasonable‚ correspondence with his Barbariana allies,.
whose retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts, and more liberal&
· promises. But AEtius poffeffed an advantage of fingular·moment im
