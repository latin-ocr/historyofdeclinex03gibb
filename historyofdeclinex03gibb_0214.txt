THE DECLINE AND FALL

devout Paula ¹¹ inher'rted and despised, are carefully recapitulated by
Jerom, the gulde of her conscience, and the historian of her life.
The genealogy of her father, Rogatus, which ascended as high as
Agamemnon, might seem to betray a Grecian origin ; but her mo·-
ther, Blaefilla, numbered the Scipios, AEmilius Paulus, and the Grac-
chi, in the list of her ancestors; and Toxotius, the husband of Paula,
deduced his royal lineage from AEneas, the father of the Julian line.
The vanity of the rich, who defired to be noble, was gratified by
these lofty preienfions. Eneouraged by the applause of their para-
fites, they easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar3 and were
countenanced‚ in some measure, by the custom of adopting the name .
of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen and
clients of illustrious families. Most of those families, however, at-
tacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay‚ were
gradually extirpated: and it would be more reasonable to seek for a
lineal descent of twenty generationS, among the mountains of the
Alps, or in the peaeeful solitude of Apulia, than on the theatre of
Rome, the seat of fortune, of danger, and of perpetual revolutions.
Under each succeflive reign, and from every province of the empire,
a crowd of hardy adventmers, rising to eminence by their talents or
their vices, usurped the wealth, the honours, and the palaces of
Rome ; and oppreffed, or protected, the poor and humble remains
of consular familie83 who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of
their ancestors ¹².
