lendar, shall not be lost in oblivion· Boldly declaring, that ,vases of
gold and silver are useless to a God who neither eats nor drinks, the
generous prelate sold the plate of the church of Amida ; employed
the price in ¹the redemption of seven thousand Persian captives ;
supplied their wants with affeffio11ate liberality3 and dismissed them
10 their native country, to inform their king of the true spirit os the
religion which he persecuted. The practice of benevolence in the
'midst of war must always tend to assuage the animolity of contending
nations; and I wish to persuade myself, that Aeacius contributed to
the restoration of peace. In the conference which was held on the
limits of the two empires‚ the Roman ambaffadors degraded the per-
sonal character of their sovereign‚ by a vain attempt to magnify the ex-
tent of his power ; when they serioussy advised the Perfians to prevent,
by a ‘timely accommodation‚ the wrath of a monarch, who was yet
ignorant of this distant war. A truce of one hundred years was
solemnly ratified3 and, although the revolutions of Armenia might
*threaten the public tranquillity‚ the effential conditione of this treaty

were respected near fourscore years by the suecessors of Constantine

and Artaxerxes.
