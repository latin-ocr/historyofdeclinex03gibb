THE DECLINE AND FALL

tions. The exigencies of the Gothic war, and the inevitable cx⁶
pcnce that accompanied the conclusion of the peace, had constrained
the emperor to aggravate the weight of the public impolitions; and

insolently thrown down from their pedestals, broken in pieees, or
dragged with contempt through the streets : and the indignities which

tumult was almost immediately suppreffed by the arrival of a body of

archers; and Antioch had leisure to refle& on the nature and conse-
