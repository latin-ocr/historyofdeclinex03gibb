OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

· (Due of the shepherds of the Huns perceived, that a heifer, who was
grazing, had wounded herself in the foot, and curioussy followed
the track of the blood, till he discovered, among the long grass, the
point of an ancient sword3 which hc dug out of the ground, and
presented to Attila. That magnanimous, or rather that ansul, prince
accepted, with pious gratitude‚ this celestial favour 3 and, as the right·
ful poffeffor of the sword of Mars, asserted his divine and indefeafible

claim to the dominion of the earth ⁰. If the rites of Scythia were

praelised on this solemn occasion, a lofty altar, or rather pile of‘

saggots, three hundred yards in length and in breadth, was raised in
a spacious plain3 and the sword of Mars was placed erec't on the
summit of this rustic altar, which was 'annually consecrated by the
blood of sheep, horses, and of the hundredth captive ¹⁰. Whether
human sacrifices formed any part of the worship of Attila, or whether
he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he continually
offered in the field of battle,> the favourite of Mars soon acquired a
sacred character, which rendered his conquests more easy, and more
‘permanent ; and the Barbarian princes confeffed‚ in the language of
devotion or flattery, that they could not presume to gaze, with a

steady eye, on the divine majesty of the kingof the Huns ¹¹.
