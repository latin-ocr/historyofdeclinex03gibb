THE DECLINE AND FALL

Arian clergy, were exaggerated by the orthodox writers. The guilt
of persecution may be imputed to Euric, king of the Vifigoth53 who
suspended the exercise of ecclefiastieal‚ or at least, of episcopal, func-
tion53 and punissied thex popular bilhops of Aquituin with impri-
sonment‚ exile, and confiscation ⁵³. But the cruel and absurd enter.-
prise of subduing the minds of a whole people‚ was undertaken by
the Vandals alone. Genseric himself, in his early youth, had ref
nounced the orthodox communi0n; and the apostate could neither
grant, nor expefl, a fincere forgiveness. He was exasperated to
find, that the Africans, who had ssed before him in' the field, still
presumed to dispute his will in synods and churches ; and his fero-
cious mind was incapable of sear, or of compassion. His Catholic
subjedhs were oppreffed by intolerant laws, and arbitrary puniffiments.
The language of Genseric was furious, and* formidable3 the know-
ledge of his intentioris might justify the‘most unfavourable interpret·-
ation of his a&ioiis; and the Arians were* reproached with the fre-
quent execufions, which stained the palace, anil the dominions, of

the tyrant. Arms and ambition were, however, the ruling paffions‘

of the monarch of the sea. But Hunneric‚ his inglori0us son, who

‘²' seemed to inherit only his vices, tormented the Catholics with the‘

same unrelenting fui-y, which had been fatal to his brother, his neu

phews, and the friends and favourites of his father. and, even' toi
