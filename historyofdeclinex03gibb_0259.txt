OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 241

and public buildings ; and the ruins of the palace of Sallust ¹⁰⁴1·cmained, xxj* ι’ ·
in the age of Justinian, a stately monument of the Gothic conflagra- μων-,4
tion¹⁰’'. Yet a contemporary historiam has obseroed, that sire could

scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid masa, and that the

strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient

structurcs. Some truth may poflibly be concealed in his devm-tt affer—-
tion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfectione· of hostile
fage ; and that the proud Forum of Rome, decorated with the statue-s
of so many gods and heroes, 'ozias Ievelled i'n the dust by the stroke
of lightning ¹⁰⁶.

that only one senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy ιω.

But it was not easy to compute the inuititudes, who, from an ho—

¹⁰⁴ The , historian sallust, who usefully
praffised the vices which he has so eloquently

censured, employed the plunder of Numidia
to adom his palace and gardens on the Qi-
r'inal hill. The spot where the house stood, is
now marked by the church of St. Susanna,
separated only by a street from the baths of
Diocletian, and not far distant from the Sala-
rian gate. See Nardini, Roma Amica, p.
192, ¹93· and the great Plan of Modern
Rome, by Nolli.

¹⁰⁵ The expressions ofProcopius are distin&
and moderate (de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. z.)-
The Chronicle of Marcellinus speaks too
strongly, partem urbis Romae cremavit3 and
the words of Philostorgius (ev ερειπιως ἐξ της
π’·υλεως κειμενη-, l. xii. c. 3.) convey a false
and exaggerated idea. Bargaeus has com-
posed a *particular dissertation (see tom. iv·
Antiquit. Rom. Graev.) to prove that the edi-
fices of Rome were not subverted by the
Goths and Vandals.

the deified Caesars. The expiet-lion which he
uses of Forum is somewhat ambiguous, since
there existedfi-ve principa] Fora ; but as they
were all contiguous and adjacent, in the plain
which is surrounded by the Capitoline, the
Qirinal, the Esquiline, and the Palatino
hilis, they might fairly be considered as eme.
See the Roma Antiqua ofDonatus‚ p. 162—
201. and the Roma Antica of Nardini, p.
ziz—273. The former is more useful for
the ancient descriptions, the latter for the
actual topography.

¹⁰⁷ Orofius (1. ii. c. 19. p. 142.) compares
the cruelty of the Gauls and the clemency of
the Goths. lbi vix quemquam inventum se-
natorem, qui vel absens evaserit5 hic vix
quemquam requiri, qui forte ut latens peri-
erit. But there is an air of rhetoric, and
perhaps of fflsehood, in this antithefis; and
Socrates (l. vii. c. ιο.) affirms, perhaps by an
opposite exaggeration, that'many senators were
put to death with various and exquisite tor-
tures.
