be protected by those arts, which survive and supply the decay of
military virtue. Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable

example of Ruffia, with a proportionable improvement in the arts of
peace and civil policy3 and they themselves must desei-ve a place
among the polished nations whom they subdue. ’
