OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

elimates of the globe have felt the viciffitudes of light and darkness.
Yet the experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes,
and diminish our apprehensions: we cannot determine to what
height the human species may aspire in their advances towards per—
fection3 but it may safely be presumed, that no people, unless the
face of nature is changed, will relapse into their original barbarism.
The improvements of society may be viewed under a threefold

aspect. ι. The poet orv philosopher illustrat-es his age and country ⁷
