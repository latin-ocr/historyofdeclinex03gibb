Codes of Theodofius and justinian ; and the same maxims have been

Yet these sanguinary laws, which spread terror among a disarmed*
and dispirited people, were of too weak a texture to restrain the
bold enterprise of Tribigild ²¹ the Ostrogoth. The colony of that
warlike nation‚ which had been planted by Theodofius in one of “

liberal rewards of Alaric3 and their leader resented, as a personal
affront, his own ungracious reception in the palace of Constantinople.

(which he might have reserved for more im-

p. 304—312.) on the revolt of Tribigild and
Gainas. See likewise Socrates, l. vi. c. 6.
and Sozomen, l. viii. c. 4. The second
book of Claudian against Eutropius, is a

very far on every fide, till their limits were
contracted by the colonies of the Bithynians
of Thrace, of the—Greeks, :md at last of the
Gauls. His description (ii. 257-273.) of
the fertility of Phrygia, and of the four ri-
vers that. produce gold, is just and pietu-
resque.
