335 THE DECL1NE AND FALL

2:12& P. founded with loud and licentious peals of laughter. In the mid‘st of
μὲν-,ν this intemperate rior, Attila alone, without a change of counten'ance,r
maintained his stedfast and inflexible gravity ; which was nev'er re-
laxed, except on the entrance of Irnac, the youngest of his sons t
he embraced the boy with a smile of paternal tenderness, gently·
pinched him by the cheek, and betrayed a partial affetffion, which
was justified by the affurance of his prophets‚ that Irnae would be
the future support of his family and empire. Two days afterwards,
the ambaffadors received a second invitati0n3 and they had reason to-
praise the politeness, as well as the hospitality, of Attila. The king
of the Huns held a long and familiar conversation with Maximin;
but his civility was interrupted by rude expressions, and haughty
reproaches 3 and he was provoked, by a motive of interest, to supporto
with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his secretary Constan-
tius. “ The emperor” (said Attila) “ has long promised him a rich
“ wife: Constantius must not be disappointed3 nor {hould a Roman
“ emperor deserve the name of liar.” On the third day, the am·-
bassadors vvere dismissed ; the freedom of several captives was granted,
for a moderate ransom, to their preffing entreaties; and, besides the·
royal presents, they vvere permitted to accept from each of the-
Soythian nobles, the honourable and useful gift of a horse. Maxi-
min returned, by the same road, to Constantinople3 and though he

was involved in an accidental dispute with Beric, the new ambass‘a·
dor of Attila, he flattered himself that he had contributed, by the

laborious journey‚ to confirm the peace and‘ alliance of the two.»
nations ⁴⁷. ’
