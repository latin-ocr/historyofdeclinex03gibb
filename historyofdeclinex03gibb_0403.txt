most distinguished guest3 who rose from his seat, and express'ed, in
the same manner, his loyal and respedfful vows. This cercmony
was succeflively performed for all, or at least for the illustrioris per-
sons of the affembly ; and a considerable time must have been con-

the rude speetators, by their deformed figure, ridiculous dress, antie
gestures, absurd speeches, and the strange unintelligible confufion of
the Latin, the Gothic, and the Hunnic languages3 and the hall re—
