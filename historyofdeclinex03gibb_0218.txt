200 ‘THE DECLINE AND FALL

cg( ἐι 1‘. required many expences of a public and ostentatious kind. Several
μηρῷ examplcs are recorded in the age of Honorius, of vain and popular
nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorssiip, by a festival, which
lasted seven days, and eost above one hundred thousand pounds ster-

proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of
Italy.

Augustus had founded as an eternal monument of the Aetian vidiory,
was the property of the devout Paula ²⁸ ; and it is observed by Se-
neca, that the rivers, which had divided hostile natione, now flowed

through the lands of private citizens ²⁹.

According to their temper
and circumstances, the estates of the Romans were either cultivated
by the labour of their ssaves, or granted, for a certain and stipu-
lated rent, to the industrious farmer. The oeconomical writers of

antiquity strenuoussy recommend the former method‚ wherever it

tive praetorlhipS, twelve‚ or twenty, or forty,
centenaries (or, hundred weight of gold).
See Olympiodor. ap. Phot. p. 197. This po-
pular estimation allows some latitude; but it
is difficult to explain a law in the Theodo-
fian Code (l. vi. leg. 5.), which fixes the
expence of the first praetor at 25,000, of the
second at 20,000‚ and of the third at 15,000
folles. The name ofsollis (see Mem. de
l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxviii.
p. 727.) was equally applied to a purse of
¹25 picces of iilver, and to a small copper
eoin of the value of ἵξῃ- part of that purse.
In the former sense, the 25,ooo folles would be
equal to 150‚ooo l. in the latter to five or fix
pounds sterling. The one appears extrava-
gant, the other is ridiculous. There must
have existed some third, and middle‘valne,
which is here understood; but ambiguity is
an inexcusable fault in the language of laws.

of the declamatory kind: but declamation
could scarcely exaggerate the avarice and lux-

self deserved some share of the reproach; §.f
it be true, that his rigorous exactiori of Qa-
dringenffes, above three hundred thousand
pounds, which he had lent at high interest,
provoked a rebellion in Britain. (Dion
Cassius, l. lxii. p. ¹003·) According to the
conjecture of Gale (Antoninus’s Itinerary in
Britain, p. 92.)‚ the same Faustinus possessed
an estate near Bury, in Suffolk, and another
in tlie kingdom of Naples.
