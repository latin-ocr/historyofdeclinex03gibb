Clovis, during five succeffive centuries, the lavas and manners of
Gaul uniformly tended to promote the increase, and to confirm the
duration‚ of personal servitude. Time and violence almost obliterated
the intermediate ranks of society; and left an obscure and narrow

national distinction, universally established by the arms and the laws
of the hierovingians. The nobles, who claimed their genuine, or
fabulous, descent, from the independent and vietorious Franks, have
