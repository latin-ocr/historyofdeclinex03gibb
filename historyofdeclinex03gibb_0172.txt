THE DECLINE AND FALL

κ--Ὗῆκ the remains of the flouyishing army which he had led into Italy.

A considerable part of the Roman forces still continued to attend his .
motions3 and Stilicho, who maintained a secret correspondence with
some of the Barbarian chiefs‚ was punGtualIy apprised of the defigns
that were formed in the camp and council of Alaric. The king of
the Goths, ambitious to fignalise his retreat by some splendid at-J- ’
chievement, had resolvedto occupy the important city of Verona,
which command-s the principal paffage of the Rhaetian Alps; and,.
directing his march through the territories of those German tribes,
whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength, to invade, on
the fide of the Rhine, the wealthy and unsuspedfing provinces of ’

” Gaul. Ignorant of the treason‚which had already betrayed his.bold and
jbudicious entcrprise‚ he advanced towards the paffes of the moun-w· 0

tains, already poffeffed by the Imperial troops; where he was expo-
sed, almost at the same instant, to a general attack in the front, on
his flanks, and in the, rear. In this bloody affion, at a small dis-
tance from the walls of Verona, the loss of. the Goths was not less -
heavy than that which they had sustained in the defeat of Pol--

lentia3 and their valiant king, who escaped by the swiftness of his ¹
horse, must either have been ssain or made* prisoner, if the hasty*
rassmess of the Alani had not disappointed the measures of the.-
Roman general. Alai-ic -secured the rcmains of his army on the ad-. ν
jacent rocks3 and preparedhimself, with undaunted resolution, toff-

maintain a siege against the superior numbers of the enemy, who
invested him on all fides. But he could not oppose the destructive„
progress of hunger and disease ; nor was it poffible for him to check
the continual desertion of his impatient and capricious Barbarians..
In this extremity he still found resources in his own courage, or in
the -moderation of his adversary3 and the retreat of >¹the Gothic
