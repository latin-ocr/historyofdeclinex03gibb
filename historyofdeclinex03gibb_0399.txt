OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

As far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure
Priscus, this capital appears— to have been seated between the Danube,
the Teyss, and the Carpathian hills, in the plains of Upper Hungary,
and most probably in the neighbourhood of Jazberin, Agria, or To²-
kay⁴³. In its origin it could be no more than an accidental camp,which‚
by the long and frequent relidence of Attila, had insensibly swelled
into a huge village, for the reception of his court, of the troops who
followed his person, and of the various multitude of idle or indus-

trious ssaves arrd retainers⁴³2 The baths, constructed by Onegefius,

from Pannonia3 and since the adjacent country was destitute even

of large timber, it may be presumed, that the meaner habitatibns of
the royal village consisted of straw‚ of mud, or of canvas. ’ The

wooden houses of the more* illustrious Huns, were built and-*sadornedf
with rude magnificenoe, according to the rank, the fortune, or the
taste of the proprietors. They seem to have been distributed with
some degree of order and symmetry; and each spot became more
» honourable, as it approached the person of the sovereign. The
palace of Attila, Which surpaffed all other houses in his dominions‚
was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample space of ground:
The outward enclosure was ahsty wall, or pallisade, of smooth'

square timber, intersected wi'th high towers, but intended rather foi·

though it appears to have been a more stable
habitatiom did ‘not 'equal the fize or splendor

The camp of Aurcngzebe, as itis so 'agree-
ahly described by Bernier (tom. ii. p. 217—-

the magnificence and luxury of Hindostan.
