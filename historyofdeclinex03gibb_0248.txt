c-xf--a These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the

wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the Gothic
king ; who employed a milder‚ though not less effectum, method
of conquest. Instead of ass'aulting the capital, he successfully di-
rected his efforts against the Port of Ostia, one of the boldest and most
stupendous works of Roman magnificence ⁸⁷. The accidents to Which
the precarious subfistence of the city was continually exposed in a win-
ter-navigation‚ and an open mad, had suggested to the genius of the
first Caesar the useful design, which was executed under the reign of
Claudius.

remains ofthis Augustam port were still vi-
fible, the antiquarians sstetched the plan (see
d'Anville, Mem. de 1⁷Academie des Inscrip-
tions‚ tom. xxx. p. 198.)‚ and declared, with
enthusiasm, that all the monarchs of Europe
would be unable to execute so great a work
(Bergier, Hist. des grands Chemins des Ro-
maim, tom. ii. p. 356.).

³⁸ The Ostia Tyberim (see Cluver. Italia
Antiq3 l. iii. p. 870—879.), in the plural
number, the two mouths of the Tyber‚
were separated by the Holy Issand, an equi-
lateral triangle‚ whose fi
them computed at about two miles. The
colony of Ostia was founded immediately be·

branch of the river3 and the distance be-
tween their remains measures something
more than two miles on Cingolani’s map. In
the time of Strabo, the saud and mud de-
pofited by the Tyber, had choked the han
bour of Ostia; the progress of the same cause
has added much to the fize ofthe Holy mand,
and gradually left both Ostia and the Port at
a considerable distance from the shore. The
dry channels (fiumi morti), and the large es-
tuaries (stagno di Ponente, de Levanre), mark
the changes of the river, and the efforts of
the sea. Consult, for the present state of this
dreary and desolate tract, the excellent map
of the eccefiastical state by the mathematicians
of Benedift XIV.; an actual survey of the
Agro Romano, in fix sheets, by Chrgolani,
which contains 1 ¹3³3 19rubbia (about 57e,0oo
