been distinguished by the martial spirit of its youth, the {kill and*
reputation of the leaders whom they had chosen, and their daring'
exploits against the innumerable host of the Barbarians. Instead of '
tamely expeffifing their approach, the Azimuntines attacked‚ in fre-
quent and successful sallies, the troops of the Huns, who gradually
declined the dangerous neighbourhood3 rescued from their hands the
spoil and the captives, and recruited their domestic force by the vo-
luntary affociation of fugitives and desertersff After the conclusion
of the treaty, Attila still menaced the empire with implacable war,
unless the Azimuntines were persuaded, or compelled, to comply
, with the conditions which their sovereign had accepted. The mi--
nisters of Theodosius confeffed with ffiame, and with truth, that they „
no longer poffeffed any authority over a society of men, who so
bravely afferted their natural independence3 and the king of the
Huns condescended to negociate an equal exchange with the citizens
of Azimus. They demanded the restitution of some shepherds, who,
with their cattle, had been accidentally surprised. A strici, though
fruitless, inquiry was allowed: but the Huns were obliged to swear,
that they did not detain any prisoners belonging to the city, before
they could recover two surviving countrymen‚ whom the Azimun-

-tines had reserved as pledges for the safety of their lost companions.
