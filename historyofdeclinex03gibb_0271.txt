OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

⁵ was consummated before the

marriage of Adolphus and Placidia¹³
Goths retired from Italy3 and the solemn, perhaps the anniversarya
day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Inge-
nuus, one of the most illustrious citizens of Narbonne in Gaul. The
bride, attired and adorned like a Roman empress, was placed on a
throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed, on this oc-
cafion, the Roman habit, contented himself with a less honourablc seat
by her fide. The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his
. nation ¹³⁶, was offered to Placidia‚ confisted of the rare and magnisi-
cent spoils of her country. Fifty beautiful youths, in filken robes,
carried a bason in each hand ; and one of these basons was filled with
pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimablc va-
lue. Attalus, so long the sport of fortune, and of the Goths, was
appointed to lead the chorus of the Hymenaeal song3 and the de-
graded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful mufician..
The Barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph3 and⁴

the provincials rejoiced in this assiance, which tempered, by the.

mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their Gothic*

lord ¹³⁷.

¹³⁵ See the pistures of Adolphus and Pla-
cidia, and the account of their marriage in
jornandes, de Reb. Geticis, c. 31. p. 654,
655. With regard to the place where the
nuptials were stipulated, or consummated,
or celebrated, the MSS. of Jornandes vary
between two neighbouring cities, Forli and
Imola (Forum Livii and Forum Cornelii).
It is fais and easy to reconcile the Gothic
historian with Olympiodorus (see Mascou,
l.' viii. c. 36.) : but Tillemont grows peevish,
and swears, that it is not worth while to try

to conciliate Jornandes with any good au-
thors.

'³⁶ The Vifigoths (the subjefts of Adol-
phus) restrained, by subsequent laws, the
prodigam! of conjugal love. It was illegal
for a husband tormake any gift or settlement

for the benefit of his wifeduring the first'

year of their marriage; and his liberality=

could not at any time exceed the tenth part z

of his property. The Lombards were some· ⁵

what more indulgent: ’ they allowed the>

night; >and this famous gift, the reward 051³
virginity, might equal the fourth part of the
hulband’s substance. Some cautious maidens,
indeed, were wise enough to stipulate before· .
hand a present, which they were too sure of¹
not deserving. See Montesquieu, Esprit des
