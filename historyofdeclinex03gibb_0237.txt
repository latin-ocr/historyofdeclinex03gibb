OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

ffie fourteen regions of the city, is accurately stated in the description
of Rome, compesed under the reign of Theodofius‚ and they
amount to forty-eight thousand three hundred and eighty-two ⁷⁰.
The two classes of domm aud of irfitlaeg‘ into which they are divided‚
include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition,
from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment
of freedmen and ssaves, to the losty and nari-ow lodging—house, where
the poet Codrus, and his wife‚were permitted to hire a wretched garret
immediately under the tilesf If we adopt the same average, which,
under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris ⁷¹, and
indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every
degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of Rome at twelve
hundred thousand : a number which cannot be thought exceflive for
the capital of a mighty empire‚ though it exceeds the populousness
of the greatestcities of modern Europe ⁷². ¹

Such was the state of Rome under the reign of Honorius3 at the

μ time when the Gothic army formed the siege, or rather the blockade‚

of the city ⁷³. By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who

domus, or great houses, of 46,6oz. insulae, or
plebeian habitations (See Nardini, Roma

are ascertained by the agreement of the texts
ofw'the different Not-stica Nar-dini, »1. viii.

from that which M Brotier, the last edim-os
Tacitus (tom. ii. p. 380.), has affumed from
similar principle33 though he seems to aim
at a degree of precifion, which it is neither
