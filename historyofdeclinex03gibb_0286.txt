racc, Singeric‚ the brother of Sarus himself, was seated on the Go-
thic throne. The first a& of his reign was the inhumari murder of
the fix children of Adolphus, the iffue of a former marriage, whom
he tore, without puy, from the feeble arms of a venerable bithop ¹⁶⁰.
The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compaflion, which
