the want of discipline, or virtue, were not supplied by the persona}
character of the monarch. Theodosius might still affe& the style, ³as
well as the title, of Jnvincible Azqugstzcs5 but he was reduced to vsolicit
the clemency of Attila, who imperioussy dietated these harsh and
humiliating conditions of peace. Ι. The emperor of the East re-,
signed, by an express or tacit convention, an extensive and important
territory, which stretched along the southern banks of the Danube,
from Singidunum 01· Belgrade, as far as Novae,·in' the diocese of
Thrace. The breadth was defined by the vague computation of fifteen

“ days journey; but, from the proposal of Attila,v to remove the fitua-

- tion of the national market‚ it soon appeared, that he comprehended

the ruined city of Naissus within the limits of his dominions.

2- ΙΙ. The king of the Huns required, and obtained, that his tribute'or

subsidy should be augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to
the annual sum of two thousand one hundred ; and he stipulated'the
immediate payment of fix thousand pounds of gold to defray the
expenceS, or to expiate the gunt, of the war. One might imagine,
t'hat such a demand, which scarcely equalled the measure of private ¹
weakh, would have been readily discharged by the opulent empire
of the East3 and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the
impoverished, or at least of the disorderly, state of the financ'es.⁴⁵² A
large proportion of the taxes, extorted from the people, was detained
and intercepted in their passage, through the foulest channels, to the
treasury of Constantinople. The revenue was diffipated b'y'Th'eodo-
slus, and his favourites, in wasteful and profuse luxury3 which was
