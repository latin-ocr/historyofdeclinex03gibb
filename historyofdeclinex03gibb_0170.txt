and Argos enriched the veterane of the WVest3 the captive wife of
Alaric, who had impatiently claimed his promise of Roman jewels
and Patrician haudmaidsw, was reduced to implore the mercy of
the insulting foe3 and many thousand -prisoners, released from the
Gothic chains, dispersed through the provinces of Italy the praises of
their heroic deliverer. The triumph of Stilicho ⁴⁷ was compared by
the poet, and perhaps by the public, to that of Marius ; who, in the
same *part of Italy, had encountered and destroyed another army
of northern Barbarians. The huge bones, and the empty hel-
mets, of the Cimbri and of the Goffis, would easily be confounded
by succeeding generations; and posterity might ere& a common
trophy to the mernory of the two most illustrious generals, who had
