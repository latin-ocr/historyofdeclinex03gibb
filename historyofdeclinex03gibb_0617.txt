‘⁶ my promise; Ι give you the people, and their weahh, as your
‘² ·p1·ey; and you may transport them at pleasure into your own
‘⁶ country.'' By the execution of this promise, Theodoric just-
ly forfeited the allegiance of a people, whom he devoted to de-
struction.. His troops, ,reinforced by the fiercest Barbarians of Ger-
many ¹⁰⁴, spread desolation over the fruitful face of Auvergne ; and
two places only, a strong castle, and a holy shrine, were saved, or

with some arable lancis, within the circle of its fortifications. The
Franks beheld ’withenvy and despair this impregnable fortress: but
they surprisedsa party os fifty stragglers; and, as they were oppreffed by
the number of their captives, they fixed‚ at a >trifling ransom, the al-
ternative os.. life or death for these wretched victims, whom the cruel
Barbarians were prepared to maffacre on the refusal of the gai-rison.

sacred and the profane spoils, were rudely torn from the altar3 and
the sacrilegious division was made at asmall distance from the town
of Brioude„ Bu't this act of impiety was severely chastised by the

devout son of Cloxis„ He punilhed with death the most atrocious ,
