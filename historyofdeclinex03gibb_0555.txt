of the vandal court; and the loathsome disease, which hastened the Cxffxsslf·
death of Hunneric, revenged the injuries, without contributing to μ-γ--ι
the defiverance‚.of the church. The throne of Africa was succeffively

filled by the two nephews of Hunnerie; by Gundamund, who Gunda-
reigned about twelve, and by Tlu·as1mund‚ who governed the na- IXUISQQ„

tion above twenty-seven, years. Their administration was hostile
and oppreffive to the orthodox party. Gundamund appeared to
⁸* ommate, or even to surpasS, the cruelty of his uncle3 and, if at
length he relented, if he recalled the bishops, and restored the freca-
dom of Athanafian worship, a pr·aematu1e death intercepted the be·-
nefits of his taldy clemency. His brother, Thrafimund, was the Thr afimu nd„

greatest and most accomplished of the Vandal kings, whom he ex· A D 49⁶

celled in beauty, prudence, and magnanimity of soul. But this
magnanimous charaeter was degraded by his intolerant zeal and de-

ceitful clemency. Instead of threats and tortures, he employed the

gentle, but efficacious, powers of seduetion. VVeasth, dignity‚ and

the royai favour, were the liberal rewards of apostacy3 the Catholics,

who had violated the laws, might purchase their pardon by the ie·
nunciation of their faith3 and whenever Thrasimound meditated any
¹ sigotous measure, he patiently waited till the indiscretion of his ad·-
vei-saties furnished him with a speclous opportunity Bigotry was

his last sentiment in the hour of death: and he exa-&ed from his
successor a solemn cath, that he wouid never tolerate the sceau-ies of
Athanasius. But his successor, Hilderic, the gentle son of the savage. Hildenlc„
Hunneric, preferred the duties of humanity and justice, ro the vain A.D. ⁵²3*

Vmarked by the ‚restoration of ,peace and universal freedom. The
throne of that vinnons, though feeble monarch, was usurped by his
