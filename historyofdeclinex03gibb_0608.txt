THE DECLINE AND FALL

dccilion of the sword, or lance, was ratified by the fannion of
This sanguinary law was
introduced into Gaul by the Burgundians ; and their legissator Gun-
dobald⁸² condescended to answer the complaints and objections of

his subje& Avitus·
to the bissmp, “ that the event of national warS‚ and private corn-

“ Is it not true,’' said the king of Burgundy

“ bats, is directed by the judgment of God3 and that his providenee
“ awards the vic‘iory to the juster cause ?” By such prevailing ar-
guments, the absurd and cruel practice of judicial duels, which had
been peculiar to some tribes of Germany, was propagated and esta-.
blished in all the monarchies of Europe, from Sicily to the Baltic.
At the end of ten centuries, the reign of legal violence was not
totally extinguissied ; and the ineffectual censures of saints, of popes,
and of synods, may seem to prove, that the influence of superstition
is weakened by its unnatural alliance with reason and humanity. The
tribunale were stained with the blood, perhaps, of innocent and re-

spectable citizens 3 the law, which now favours the rich, then yielded

—to the strong3 and the old, the feeble, and the infirm, were con-

demned, either to renounce their fairest claims and poffeffions, to
sustain the dangers of an unequal confli& ⁸³, or to trust the doubtful
aid of a mercenary champion. This oppreffive jurisprudence was
imposed on the provincials of Gaul, who complained of any inju-

thc Pious; his biographer observes, secun-
dum legem propriam, utpote quia uterque
Gothus erar, equestri pugna congreffus est
(Vit. Lud. Pii, c. 33. in tom. vi. p. ¹03·)·
Ermoldus Nigellus (l. iii. 543-628. in tom.
vi. p. 48—50.), who describes the duel, ad-
mires the, ars nova of fighting on horseback,
which was unknown to the Franks.

⁸² In his original edici, publiihed at Lyons
(A. D. 501.), Gundobald establishes and
j-ustifics the use ofjudicial combat (Leg. Bur-
gund. tit: xlv. in vtom. ii. p. 267, 268.).
Three hundred years afterwards, Agobard,

3

bishop of Lyons, solicited Lewis the Pious to
arel-ish the law of an Arian tyr-ant (in tom.
vi. p. 356—358.).' He relates the conver·
sation oqundobald and Avitus.

⁸³ “ Accidit (says Agobard), ut non> so-
“ lum valentes viribus, ‘sed etiam infirmi et
‘⁶ senes lacessantur ad pugnam, etiam pro
“ viliffimis rebus. Qibus foralibus certa·
“ minibus contingunt homicidia injusta3 et
“ crudeles ac perversi eventus judiciorum.”
Like a prudent rhetorician, he suppress'es the
legal privilege of hiring champions.
