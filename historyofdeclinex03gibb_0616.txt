THE DECLINE AND FALL

nobles had fallen in the battle ‘of poitiers, they accepted, without
reiistancc, a vietorious and catholic sovereign. This easy and va-
luable conquest was atchicvcd, and possessed, by Theodoric, the
eldest son of Clovis: but the remote province was separated from his
Austrafian dominions, by the intermediate kingdoms of Soiffons,
Paris, ‘and Orleans, which formed, after their father⁸3 death, the
inheritance of his three brothers. The king of Paris, Childebert,
was tempted by the neighbourhood and beauty of Auvergne ¹⁰². The

Upper country, which rises towards the south into the mountains of

the Cevennes, presented a rich and various prospect of woods and
pastures; the fides of the hills were clothed with vinesj and each
eminence was crowned with a villa or castle. In the Lower Auvergne,

‘the river Allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne3

and the inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied, and still supplies,
without any interval of repose, the constant repetition of the same

'harvests ¹⁰³. On the false report, that their lawful sovereign had been

ssain in Get-many, the city and diocese of Auvergne were betrayed
by the grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris. Childebert enjoyed this ”
clandestine victory3 and the free subjects of Theodoric threatened to
desert his standard, if he indulged his private resentment‚ while the
nation was engaged in the Burgundian war. But the Franks of
Austrafia soon yielded to the persuafive eloquence of their k'ing.
