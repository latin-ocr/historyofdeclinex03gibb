the apostle of Armenia, the archbishop was
always of the royal family; a circumstance,
which, in some degree, corrected the in-
fluence of the sacerdotal character, and united

the mitre with the crown.

Without depending on the various and con-
tradifiory periods of the reigns of the last
kings, we may be affuredrthat the ruin of
the Armenian kingdom happened aster the
