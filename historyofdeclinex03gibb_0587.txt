OF THE ROMAN' EMPIRE.

legitimate, progeny of the Roman legions, was distinguished in the
fuceeeding age by their arms, their enfigns, and their peculial· dress
and institutions. But the national strength was incr-cased by these
powerful and voluntary accessions3 and the neighbouring kingdoms
dreaded the numbers, as well as the spirit, of the Franks. The re·-

ceffions, as were adequate to its real value.⁴ His savage character,
and the virtues of Henry IV. suggest the most opposite ideas of
human nature: yet some resemblance may be found in the situation
of two princes, who conquered France by their valour, their policy,

and the merits of a seasonable conversion ³⁶.
