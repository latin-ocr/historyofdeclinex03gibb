¹42 'THE DECLJNE AND FALL

05Χρ Ρ· A Grecian philosopher ²⁰, who visited Constantinople soon after the

&laq—T) death of Theodosius, published his lihsral opinions concerning the
al'lc 13 ( C-

clarcd nm- dudcs os kings, and the state of the Roman republic. Synefius ob-

ἓξζὴρὶζῇὲιῃ] serves, a‘nd deplores the fatal abuse, which the imprudent bounty

{lyss‘f‘ssg' of the late emperor had introduced into the military service. The
citizens, and subjecits, had purchased an exemption from the indis-
pensable duty of defending {heir country; which was supported by
the arms of Barbarian mercenaries. 'The fugitives of Scythia were
permitted to disgrace the illustrious dignities of the empire; their Δ
serocious youth, who disdained the salutary restraint of laws, were
more anxious to acquire the riches, than to imitate the arts, of a
people, the obje& of their contempt and hatred3 and the power of
the Goths was the stone of Tantalus, perpetually suspended over
the peace and safety of ‚the devoted state. The measures, which
Synesius recommends, are the dictates of a bold and generous pa-
triot. He exhorts the emperor to revive the courage of his subjecte»,
¹by the example of manly virtue 3 to banish luxury from the court,
and from the camp ; to substitute, in the place of the Barbarian mer-
cenaries„ an army of men, interested in the defence of their laws and
of their property3 to force, in such a moment of public danger, the
mechanic from his ssiop, and the philosopher from his school-3 to
rousethe indolent citizen from his dream of pleasure, and to arm,
for the protection of agriculture, the hands of the laborious husband-
man. At the head of such troops, who might deserve the name,
and would display the spirit, of Romans, he animates the son of ’
Theodofius to encounter a race of Barbarians, who were destitute of
:any real courage3 and never to lay down his arms, ,till he had

²⁰ Synesius passed three years (A. D. 397 de Regno (p. 1032. edit. Petav. Paris
-400.) at Constantinople, as deputy from 1612.). The philosopher was made bishop
Cyrene to the emperor Arcadius. He pre· of Ptolemais, A. D. 4105 and died about

sented him with a crown of gold, and pro· 430. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tonuxii.
