But the influence of this elaborate instruction did not penetrate
beyond the surface; and the skilful preceptore, who so accu-
rately guided the steps of their royal pupil, could not infuse into
his feeble and indolem chal-adier, the vigorous and independent
principle of action, which rendere> the laborious pursnit of glory
effentially neceffary to the happiness, and almost to the existence,
of the hero. As soon as time and accident had removed those
faithful counseliors from the throne, the emperor of the West
insensibly descended to the levei of his natm-al genius; abandoned
the teins of governrnent to the ambitious hands which were stretched
forwards to grasp them3 and amused his leisnre with the most fri-
volous gratifications. A public sale of favour and injustice was in-
stituted, both in the court, and in the province8‚ by the worthless
delegates of his power, whose merit, it was' made sacrilege to question ³.
The conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and
bishops⁴3 who procured an Imperial edi& to punish, as a capital

praetorian praefensture of Italy (A. D. 377.)‚

a theological treatise on the saith of the Tri-
nity: and Tillemont (Hist. des Empmeurs,

tom. v. p. 158. 169.) ascribes to the arch-
bissmp the merit of Gratian’s intolerant laws.

omittunt, aut negligendo violant, et offen-
dunt, sacrilegium committunt. Codex Justi-

deed may caim his share, in the merit of this
comprehensive law.
