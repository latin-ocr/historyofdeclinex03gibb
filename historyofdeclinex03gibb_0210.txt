THE DECLINE AND FALL

placable war, the perfidious nation, that had so bafely violated the
laws of hospitality. By the imprudent conclu& of the ministers of
Honorius, the republie lost the affistance‚ and desei-ved the enmity‚
of thirty thousand of her bravest soldicrsz and the weight of that

Romans, unless AEtius and Jason‚ the sons of two ¹ great officers of
