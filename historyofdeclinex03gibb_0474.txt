456 - THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

ngx‘isssp' granted an universal amnesty, a final and absolute discharge of an ς
b—w-—a’ arrears of tribute, of all debts, which, under any pretence, the fiscal Ἰ Ἱ·
officers might demand from the people. This wisc dcrelidliou of
obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and purified
the sources of the public revenue 3 and the subject, who could now ·',
look back without despair, might labour with hope and gratitudev ⁴
for himself and for his country. ΙΙ. In the affeflinent and collection· l

⁸ magistrates ; and suppreffed the extraordinary commiflions which had
been introduced, in the name of the emperor himself, or of the Prae-
torian praefeosts. The favoun‘te servants, who obtained such irregulari· ³,
powers, were insolent in their behaviour, and arbitrary in their de'. ·
mands: they affected to despise the subordinate t1·ibunals„and they l,

stance of their extortion w0uld appear incredible‚ were it notamhem
ticated by the legissator himself. They exacted the whole rpayoenent
in gold: but they refused the current coin of the empire, and would l
accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of
Faustina or 'the Antoninos. The subject, who was unprovided
with these curious medals, had recourse to the expedient of CQIL: Α
pounding with their rapacious demands ; or, if he succeedcd iix-,the
rcsearch, his imposition was doubled‚ according to ,theweight-‚nqnfl
value of the money of former times ⁴². ΙΙΙ. “ ΤΙῑε ιῑιυηίεἰΡξιξρομῃ
