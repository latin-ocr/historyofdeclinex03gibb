oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 107

to repair, without delay, to a military station on the banks of the 0:543( P.

Danube: and the death of that general (though he was ssain in a u-wv—-d
sscirmissi with the Barbarians) was imputed to the perfidious arts of
Rufinus ⁵. The sacrifice of an hero gratified his revenge3 the

honours of the consulship elated his vanity3 but his power was still
imperfe& and precarious, as long as the important posts of praese&
of the East‚ and of praese& of Constanfinople, were filled by Ta-
tian ⁶, and his son Proculus3 whose united authority balanced, for
some time, the ambition and favour of the master of the offices. The
two praefed‘ts were accused of rapine and corruption in the admini-
stration of the laws and finances. For the trial of these illus-
trious offenders, the emperor constituted a special commiffion : seve-
ral judges were named to share the guilt and reproach of injustice ς
but the right of pronouncing sentence was reserved to the president
alone, and that president was Rufinus himself. The father, stripped
of the praefesture of the East, was thrown into a dunge0n3 but the
son, conscious that few ministers can be found innocent, where an ene-
my is their judge, had secretly escaped ; and Rufinus must have been
satisfied with the least obnoxious vififim, if despotism had not conde-
scended to employ the basest and most ungenerous artifice. The
prosecution was conduCted with an appearance of equity and mo-

derafion, which flattered Tatian with the hope of a favourable event;
his confidence was fortified by the solemn affurances‚ and perfidious
oaths‚ of the president, who presumed to interpose the sacred name
of Theodofius‘himself ; and the unhappy father was at last persuaded
to recal‚ by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus. He was in-
