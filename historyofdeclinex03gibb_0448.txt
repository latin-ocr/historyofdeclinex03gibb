¹which he was secretly accused, excited the fears, as'well as the re·-
rl'entment, of Valentinian. AEtius himself, supported by the con-
‘sciousness of his merit, his services, and perhaps his innocence,
seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet behaviour. The
cpatrician offended his sovereign by an hostile declaration ; he aggra-
