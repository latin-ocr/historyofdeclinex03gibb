their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the
noble families, which contended only for the second place ¹³. Dur-

ing the five first ages of the city, the name of the Anicians was un·-
known3 they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste31

and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the
Plebeian honours of tribunes of the peopleffi One hundred and
sixty-eight years before the Christian aera, the family was ennobled by
the Praetorship of Anicius, who glorioussy terminated the Illyrian
war by the conquest of the nation, and the captivity of their king ¹⁵.
From the triumph of that general, three consulships‚ in distant pe-

riods, mark the sueceffion of the Anician name ¹⁶. From the reign of

Diocletian to the final extinction of the Western empire, that name
ihone with a lustre which was not eclipsed in the public estimation, by

the maj esty of the Imperial purple ¹⁷. The several branches, to whom

it was communicated‚ united, by marriage or inber-nanee, the wealth

they all agree, that whatever may be the
true reading, the sense of Clandian can be
applied only to the Anician family.

He fairly appreciates the merit of Anicius,
and justly observes, that his fame was cloud-
ed by the superior lustre of the Macedonian,
which preceded the IHyrian, triumph.

¹⁶ The dates of the three consulships are,
A. U. C. 593, 818, 967: the two last un-
der the reigns of Nero and Caracalla. The
second of these consuls distinguished himself
only by his infamous flattery (Tacit. Annal.
xv. 74.): but even the evidence of crimes,
if they bear the stamp of greatness and anti-
quity, is admitted, without relunance„ to

hius, is that of M. Anicius Gallus. Trib. prove the genealogy ofa noble house.

Rome.
