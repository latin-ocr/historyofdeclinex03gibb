OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

“ of the people, they consent that the seat of universal‘empire {hall
“ be transferred from Rome to Constantinople3 and they basely
“ renounce the right of chufing their master, the only vestige that
“ yet remained of the authority which had given lawe to the world.
'⁴‘ The republie (they repeat that name without a biush) might
'“ safely confide in the civil and militarvairtues of Odoacer 3‘and
“ they humbly request, that the emperor would invest him with the
“ title of Patrician, and the administration of the diocese of Italy.”
The deputies of the senate were received at Constantinople With
some marks of displeasure and indignation5 and when they were
admitted to the audience of 'Zeno, he sternly reproached them with
their treatment of the two emperors, Anthemius and Nepos, whom
*the East had succeffively granted to the prayer-s of Italy. “ The first”
(continued he) “ you have murdered3 the second you have expelled 1
“ *but the second is still alive, and whilst he lives he is your lawfu}
“ sovereign.” But ‘the prudent Zeno soon deserted the hopelefiz
cause of his abdicated colleague. His vanity was gratified by the
title of sole emperor, and by the statues ereeted to his honour in
' the several quarters of Rome ; he entertained a friendly, though am·-
biguous, correspondence with the patrician Odoacer; and he grate-
'fully accepted the Imperial enfigns, the sacred ornaments, of the
throne and palace, which the Barbarian was not unwilling to re·-
move from the fight of the 'people ¹²⁴. V ι

In the space of twenty years fince the dea-th of Valenfinian, 111116
>emperors had sueceffively disappeared3 and the son of Orestes, a
youth recommended only by his beauty, would be the least entitled
to the notice of poster-ny, if his reign, which was marked by the
:extinet‘ion of the Roman empire in the West, did not leave a me-

¹²⁴ Malc'hus, whose loss excites om· regnet, Zeno. The anonymous fragment (p. 717.),
'has preserved (in Excerpt. Legat. 'p. 93.) thi‘s and' the extra& from Candidus (apud Phot-
extraordinary embass'y from the senate to p. 176.), are likewise of some'use. -
