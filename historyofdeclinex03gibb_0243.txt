At the distance of fourteen centuries, we may be satisfiet} with
relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without
presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct. In
the midst of his apparent prosperity, Alaric was conscious, perhaps,
of some secret weakness, some internal defe&; or perhaps the mo-
deration Which he displayed, was intended only to deceive and dis-
arm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius. The king of
the Goths repeatedly declared, that it was his desire to be considered
as the friend of peace, and of the Romans. Three senators, at his
earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to
solicit the exchange of hostages, and the conclusion of the treaty;
and the propos-als, which he more clearly expreffed during the course
of the negociadons, could only inspire a doubt of his fincerity, as
they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune. The Bar-

he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and Venetia, for the
