THE mcum AND FALL

C H A P. morable AEra in the history of mankind ¹²⁵· The patrician oreste&
XXXVI· had married the daughter of Count Romulus, of Retovio‚ in Noricum:

the name of Atcgtstus, notwithstanding the jealousy of power, was
known at Aquileia as a familiar surname3 and the appellations of
the two great founders, of the city, and, of the monarchy, were thus
strangely united in the last of their succeffors ¹²⁶. The son of Orestes
assumed and disgraced the names of Romulus Augustus3 but the
first was corrupted into Momyllus, by, the Greeks, and the second
has been changed by the Latins into the contemptible diminutive
Augustulus. The life of this inoffenfive y‘outh was spared by the
generous cle'mency of Odoacer; who dismissed him, with his whole
family, from the Imperial palace, fixed his annual allowanceht fix

thousand picces of gold, and affigned‘ the castle of Lucullus, in 'Cam-

pania, for the place of his exile ,or retirement ¹²⁷. As soon a's the*
Romans breathed from the toils of the Punic war, they were at-
traeted by the beanties and the pleasures of Campaniam {ind 'the

country-house of the elder Scipioat Liternum, exhibited a lasting

model of their rustic fiinplicity ¹²³

¹²⁵ The precise year in which the Western
empire‘was extinguished, is not pofitively as·
certained. The vulgar aera of A. D. 476,
appears to ha've the sanfflon of authentic chro-
nicles. But the two dates afligned by Jor-
nandes (c 46. p. 680. )‚ would delay that great

event to the year 479: and though Μ, de·

Buat has overlooked bis evidence, he pro-
duces (tom. viii. p. 261—288. ) many colla-
tei-al circumstances in ,support of the same
opinion.
