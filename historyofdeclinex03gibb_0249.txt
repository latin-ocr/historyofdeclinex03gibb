OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Roman Port insenfibly swelled to the fize of an episcopal city ⁸⁹,
where the corn of Africa was deposited in spacious granaries for the
use of the capital. Ae soon as Alaric was in posi'effion of that im-
portant place, he summoned the city to surrender at discretion3 and
his demands were enforced by the positive declaration, that a re-
fusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruc-
tion of the magazines, on which the life of the Roman people de-

pended. The clamours of that people, and the terror of famine,
subdued the pride of the senate; they listened, without reluctance,
to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the un-
worthy Honorius3 and the suffrage of the Gothic conqueror be—
stowed the purple on Attalus, praefe& of the city. The grateful
monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master—general
of the armies of the West ; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the
domeffics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the two

hostile nations seemed to be united in the elosest bands of friendlhip Ἰ

and alliance ⁹⁰.
