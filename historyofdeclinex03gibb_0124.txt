106 TH'E DECLINE AND FALL

(3ΧῇΙῂ P. urged Rufinus to abandon his native country, an obscure corner of
·.....v..-..a Gaul ², to advance his fortune in the capital of the East: the talent
of bold and ready elocution³ qualified him to succeed in the lu·-
crative profession of the law3 and his success in that profeffion was
a regular step to the most honourable and important employments of
the state. He was raised, by just degrees, to the station of master
of the offices. In the exer-eise of his various functions, so es-
sentially connected with the whole system of civil government, he
acquired the confidence of a monarch, who soon discovered his dili-
gence and capacity in bufiness, and who long remained ignorant of
the pride, the malice, and the covetousness of his disposition. These
vices were concealed beneath the mask of profound diffimulation ⁴3
his paffions were subservient only to the paffions of his master: yet,
in the horrid maffacre of Thessalonica, the cruel Rufinus inflamed
the fury, without imitating the repentance, of Theodofius. The
minister, who viewed with proud indifference the rest of mankind,
never forgave the appearance of an injury3 and his personal ene-
mies had forfeited‚ in his opinion, the merit of all public services.
Promotus, the master-general of the infantry, had saved the empire
from the invasion of the Ostrogoths; but he indignantly supported
the pre-eminence of a rival, whose character and profeffion he de-
spised ; and, in the midst of a public council, the impatient soldier
was provoked to chastise with a blow the indecent pride of the fa-
vourite. This a& of violence was represented to the emperor as an
iusuk, which it was incumbent on his dignity to resent. The dis-
grace and exile of Promotus were fignified by a peremptory order,
