The deaths of AEtius and Valentinian had relaxed³ the ties which C H Α P-

held the Barbarians of Gaul in peace and subordination* ‘The sexi*- ww

coast was infested by the Saxons3 the Alemanni and the F rankssadd
vanced from the Rhine to the Scine 3 and the ambition of* the Go'th‘sb J
leemed to meditate more extenfive and permanent conquests. The
emperor ·Maximus relieved himself, by a judici-ons choice, from
the weight of these distant cares; he filenced the solicitations of his
friends, listened to the voice of same, and promoted a stranger to
‘the general command of the forces in Gaul. Avitus ³², the stranger‚

whose merit was so nobly rewarded, descended from a wealthy
and honourable family in the diocese of Auvergne. The convul—
fions of the times urged him to embrace, with the same ardour, the

civil and military profeffions; and the indefatigable youth blended
the studies of literature and jurisprudence with the exercise >of arms

and huntingss Thirty years of his life were laudably spent in the
public service ; he alternately displayed his talents in war and nego-
ciation 3 and the soldier of AEtius, after executing the most import-'
ἵ ant embaflies, was raised to the station of Praetorian prae'fee'c of
Gaul. Either the merit of Avitus excited envy, or his moderatim
was defu-ons of repose, fince he cal-mly retired to an estate, which he
¹possessed in the neighbourhood of Clermont. A copious stream,
iffuing from the mountain, and falling headlong in many a loud
and foaming cascade, discharged its waters into a lake about two
miles in length, and the villa was pleasantly seated on the margin
of the lake. The baths, the porficoes, the summer and winter
apartments, 'were adapted to the purposes of luxury and use ς and

the adjacent country afforded the various prospecte of woods‚ pas·-

:aq-he private life and elevation of Avi- donius Apollinaris, his subject, and his son-
,tus must be deduced, with becoming suspi- in-law.
