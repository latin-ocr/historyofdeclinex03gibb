OF THE ‘ROMAN EMPIRE.

dence, derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger,
irretrievably wasted the decifive moments of peace and war. While
they expected, in sullen silence, that the Barbarians lhould evacuate
the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid marches‚ passed the
Alps and the Po3 hastily pillaged the cities of Aquileia, Altinum,
Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to his arms ; increased his
forces by the acceflion of thirty thousand auxiliarie33 and, without
meeting a single enemy in the field, advanced as far as the edge of
the morass which prote&ed the impregnable refidence of the emperor
of the West. Instead of attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna,
the prudent leader of the Goths proceeded to Rimini, stretched his-

ravages along the sea-coast of the Hadriatic‚ and meditated the con-
quest of the ancient mistress of the world. An Italian hermit, whose

himself was confounded by the solemn affeveration of Alaric, that he
felt a secret and praeternatural impulse, which directed, and even
compelled, his march to the gates of Rome. He felt, that his genius
and his fortune were equal to the most arduous enteiprises 3 and the
enthufiasm which he communicated to the Goths, insensibly removed
the popular, and almost superstitious, reverence of the nations for
the majesty of the Roman name. His troops, animated by the hopes
of spoil, followed the course of the Flaminian way, occupied the
unguarded paffes of the Apennine ⁴, descended into the rich plains
