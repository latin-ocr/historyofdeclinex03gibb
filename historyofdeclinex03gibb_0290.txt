and even the existence, of that hero, have been justly arraigned by
the impartial severity of modern criticism ¹⁶⁸.

The ruin of the opulent provinces of Gaul may be dated from the
establishmcnt of these Bai-barinus, whose alliance was dangerous and
oppreffive, and who were capricioussy impelled, b'y interest or pas.-
lion, to violate the public peace. A heavy and partial ransom was
{mposed on the surviving provincials, who had escaped the calamities
of war ; the fairest and most fertile lands were affigned to ¹the rapa-
cious strangers, for the use of their families‚ their ssaves, and their
cattle ; and the trexnbling natives relinquished with a figh the inhee
ritanee of their fathers. Yet these domestic misfortunes‚ which are
seldom the lot of a vanquissted people, had been felt and inflic‘ced by
the Romans themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign con·
quest, but in the madness of civil discord. The Triumvirs proscribed
eighteen of the most flourissiing colonies of Italy3 and distributed
their lands and houses to the veterane who revenged the death of
Caesar, and opprefl'ed the liberty of their country. Two poets, of
unequal fame, have deplored‚ in fimilar circumstances, the loss of
their patrimony: but the legionaries of Augustus appear to have
surpaffed‚ in violence and injustice‚ the Barbarians‚ who invaded
Gaul, under the reign of Honorius. It was not without the utmost
difficulty that virgil escaped from the sword of the Centurion, who·
had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua¹⁶⁹ ς but Pau.
