disdaining to fiy before the robbers of Germany, exeited Alaric to ι-ψ-Α

affert in arms the name and blood of the conqueror of Rome. The
advice of the graver chiestains preffed him to elude the first ardon-r
of the Franks3 and to expect, in the southern provinces of Gaul,
'the veteran and viCtorious Ostrogoffls, whom the king of Italy had
already sent to his affistanee. The decifive moments were wasted
in idle deliberation ,ς the Goths too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an
advantageous post; and the opportunity of a secure retreat was

whose defeat. was already prepared by terror and confusion. Yet
they rallied in their extreme disti-ess, and the martial youths, who
had clamoroussy demanded the battle, refused to survive the igno-

rode against him, to revenge the death of their sovereign. Ther
vague expression of a mountain of the ssain, serves to indicate a
cruel„ though indefinite, ssaughter; but Gregory has carefully ob-
