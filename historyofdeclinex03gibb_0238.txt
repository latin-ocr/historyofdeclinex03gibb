and most plentiful supply of provisions. The first emotions of the
nobles, and of the people, were those of surprise and indignation

that a vile Barbarian ssiould dare to insult the capital of the world:
but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune3 and their
unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms,
was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim. Per-
haps in the person of Serena, the Romans might have re—
spected the niece of Theodofius‚ the aunt, nay even the adoptive
mother, of the reigning emperor z but they abhorred the widow of
Stilicho; and' they listened with credulous paffion to the tale of ca-
lumny, which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal cor-
respondence with the Gothic invader. Actuateth or overawed, by
the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence.
of her guih, pronounced the sentence of her death. Serena was
ignominioussy strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished
to find, that this cruel a& of injustice did not immediately produce
the retreat of the mearians, and the deliverance of the city. That
unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at
length the horrid calamities of famine. The daily allowance of three

pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one—third, to nothing; -

and the price of (corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extrava-

gant proportion. The poorer citizens, who were unable to purchase ¹ ε

the neceffaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich3

and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of

Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratiam, ‘who had fixed her resi--

dence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the
princely revenue, which ssle annually received from the grateful
succeffors of her husband ⁷⁴. But these private and temporary dona·-
tives were insufficient to appeasc the hunger of a numerous people3
