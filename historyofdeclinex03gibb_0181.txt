mained, during some ages, a vast and dreary solitude 3 till the hu·-
man species was renewed by the powers of generation, and the
vacancy was filled by the influx of new inhabitants. The nations
who now usurp an extent of land, which they are unable to culti-

the banks of the Upper Danube. The emperor of the west, if his
ministers disturbed his amusements by the news of the impending
danger, was satisfied with being the occafion, and the spe&ator of

efficacious means to arrest, or allure, the deserters ; and offered the gift
of freedom, and of two pieces of gold, to all the ssaves who would
