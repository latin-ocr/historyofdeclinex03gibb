OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Afia ⁵³. From these stately palaces iffued a sxa-arm of dirty and rag-
ged plebeians, without shoes, and without a mantlc; who loitered
away whole days in the street or Forum, to hear news, and to hold
dispute83 who diffipated, in extravagant gaming, the miser-able pit-
tance of their wives and children ; and spent the hours of the night
in obscure taverns‚ and brothels, in the indulgence of gross and vul-
gar senstlality ⁵⁹.

But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multi-
tude, depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and
specstacles. The piety of Christian princes had snppreffed the inhu-
