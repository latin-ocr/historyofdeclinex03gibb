OF THE ROMAN EMPIREs

eunuch could no longer alarm the fears of his cnemies 3 nor was hc
capable of enjoying what yet remained, the comforts of peace, of
solitude‚ and of a happy climate. But their implacable revenge still
envied him the last moments of a miserable life, and Eutropius had
no sooner touched the shores of Cyprus, than he was hastily rccalled.
The vain hope of eluding‚ by a change of place, the obligation of
an oath, engaged the empress to transfer the scene of his trial and
execution, from Constantinople to the adjacent suburb of Chalcedon.
The consul Aurelian pronounced the sentence; and the motives of

that sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government.
The crimes which Eutropius had committed against the people,
might have justified his death3 but he was found guilty of harneffing
to his *chariot the fizcred animals‚ who, from their breed, or colour,

were reserved for the use of the emperor alone ³².

While this domestic revolution was transacted‚ Gainas³³ openly
revolted from his allegiance 3 united his forces, at Thyatira in Lydia,
with those of Tribigild3 and still maintained his superior ascendant
over the rebellious leader of the Ostrogoths. The confederate armies
advanced, without refistance, to the Streights of the Hellespont‚ and
the Bosphorus3 and Arcadius was instrue‘ced to prevent the loss of
his Afiatic dominions‚ by refigning his authority and his person to
the faith of the Barbarians. The church of the holy martyr Euphe-
mia, fituate on a lofty eminence near Chalcedon ³⁴, was chosen for

'the place of the interview. Gainas bowed, with reverence‚ at the
feet of the emperor, whilst he required the sacrifice of Aurelian and
