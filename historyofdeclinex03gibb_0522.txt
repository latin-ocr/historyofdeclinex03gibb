504 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Cxffxsslf’· A monarchy destitute of national union‚ and hereditary right,v
t-—v-t hastened to its diffolution. After a reign of fourteen years, odoacer

was oppreffed by the superior genius of Theodoric, king of the
Ostrogoths; a hero alike excellent in the arts of war and of go-

vernment, who restored an age of peace and prosperity, and whose
name still excites and deserves the attention of mankind.
