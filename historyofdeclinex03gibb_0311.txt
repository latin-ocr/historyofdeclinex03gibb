and the Ostrogoths, attacked in a narrow pass, between the city of

, a deep momss, and the craggy clifts of Mount Taurus,
were defeated with the loss of their bravest troops. But the spirit
of their chief was not daunted by misfortune3 and his army was
continually recruited by swarms of Barbarians and oudaws, who
were defirous of exercifing the profeffion of robbery, under the

more honourable names of war and conquest. The rumours of the
success of Tribigild might for some time be suppreffed by fear, or
disguised by flattery3 yet they gradually alarmed both the court and
the capital. Every misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful>
hints; and the future designs of the rebels became the subje& of
anxious conjecture. WVhenever Tribigild advanced into the inland
country, the Romans were inclined to suppose that he* meditated
the passage of Mount Taurus, and the invasion of Syria. . If he (le-⁷
scended towards the sea, they imputed, and perhaps suggested, to
the Gothic chief, the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in
the harbours of Ionia, and of extending his depredations along the
maritime coast, from the mouth of the Nile to the port of Constan-
tinople. The approach of danger, and the obstinacy of Tribigild,
who refused all terms of accommodation‚ compelled Eutropius to
summon a council of war²⁵. After· claiming for himself the privilege
