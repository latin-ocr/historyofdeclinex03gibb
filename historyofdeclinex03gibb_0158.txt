THE DECLINE AND FALL

of Paganism5 aud the mysteries of Ceres, which had subfisted
eighteen hundred years, did not survive the destruoion of Eleusis,

and the calamities of Greece ²⁵.

The last hope os a people who could no longer depend on their
arms, their gods, or their sovereigu‚ was placed in the powersul
affistance ofthe general of the W'est3 and Stilicho, who had not been
permitted to repulse, advanced to chastise‚ the invaders of Greeee ¹⁶.
A numerous fleet was equipped in the ports of Italy; and the troops,
after a short and prosperous navigation over the Ionian sea, were
safely disembarked on the isthmus, near the ruins of Corinth. The
woody and mountainous country of Arcadia, the fabulous refidence
of Pan and the Dryads, became the scene of a long and doubtful

life. Riches begat pride; they disdained

their privilege, and they suffered. Polybius «
advises them to retire once more within theii-
magic circle. See a :learned and judicions
