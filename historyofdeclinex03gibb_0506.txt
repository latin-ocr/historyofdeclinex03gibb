The senator Olybrius, of the Anician family, might esteem him-
self the lawful heir of the Western empire. He had married Pla-
cidia, the younger daughter of Valentinian‚ after she was restored
by Genseric; who still detained her fister Eudoxia, as the wife, =or
rather as the captive, of his son. The king of the Vandals sup·-
ported‚ by threats and solicitations, the fair pretensions of his Roman

the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful pri-nce, and the
unworthy preference which they had given to a stranger¹⁰⁶, The
friendlhip of the public enemy might render Olybrius still more un-
popular to the Italians ; but when Ricimer meditated the ruin of the
emperor Anthemius, he tempted with the offer of a diadem the can-
didate who could justify his rebellion by an illustrious name, and a
royal alliance. The husband of Placidia, who, like most of his an-
cestors, had been invested with the consular dignky, might have
continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune in the peaceful rc-

importuniues of liis friends, perhaps of his wife3 rashly plunged

connivance of the emperor Leo, accepted the Italian purple, which
was bestowed, and resumed, at the capricious will of a Barbarian.
He landedwithout obstacle (for Genseric was master of the sea)
either at Ravenna or the port of Ostia, and immediately proceeded
