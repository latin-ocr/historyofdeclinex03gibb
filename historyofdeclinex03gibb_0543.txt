of an aerial pennance. At the age of thirteen, the young Syrian styhtes

deserted the profession of a shepherd, and threw him1elf into an
austere monastery. After a long and painful noviciate, in which
Simeon was repeatedly saved from pious suicide, he establiihed his
refidence on a mountain, about thirty or forty miles to the East of
Antioch. Within the space of a mandra, οι· circle of stones, to
which he had attached himself by a ponderous chain, he ascended a
column, which was succeffively raised from the height of nine, to
that of fixty‚ feet, from the ground ⁷⁰. In this last, and losty, sta-
tion, the Syrian Anachoret resisted the heat of thirty summme, and
the cold of as many wintere. Habit and exercise instructed him to
maintain his dangerous situation without fear or giddiness, and suc-
cessively to assume the different postures of devotion. He sometimes
prayedin an ere& attitude, with his out—stretched arms, in the figure
of a cross3 but his most familiar practice was that of bending his
meagre sszeleton from the forehead to the feet: and a curious spec-
