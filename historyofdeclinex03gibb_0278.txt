THE DECLINE AND FALL

tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who,
after three ineffeChiaI strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in
his heart ¹⁵⁰. The unprotecC'oed Maximus, whom he had invested
with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was
entertained of his power and abilities. Thc caprice of the Barba-
