k--v-—a to the policy, of the conqueror. His throne was encompaffed with

domestic enemies3 who accused the baseness of his birth, and asserted
the legitimate claims of his nephews, the sons of Gonderic. Those
nephews, indeed, he sacrificed to his safety3 and their mother, the
widow of the deceased king, was precipitated‚ by his order, into the
river Ampsaga. But the public discontent burst forth in. dangerous
and frequent conspiracies3 and the war-like tyrant is supposed to-
have {hed more Vandal blood by the hand of the executiones, than
in the field of battle³⁵. The convulfions of Africa, which had fa-
voured his attack, opposed the firm establissiment of his power ; and
the various seditions of the Moors and Germans, the Donatists and·
Catholics‚ continually disturbed, or threatened, the unsettled reign
of the conqueror. As he advanced towards Carth-age, he was forced
to withdraw his troops from the Western provinces; the sea—coast
was exposed to the naval enterprises of the Romans of Spain and,
Italy3 and, in the heart of Numidiar the strong inland city of Corta
still perfisted in obstinate independence ³⁶.. These difficulties were.
gradually subdued by the spirit, the perseverance‚ and the cruelty of
Genseric; who alternately applied the arts of peace and war to the
establishment of his African kingdom. He subscribed a solemn..
treaty‚ with the hope of deriving some advantage from the term of.-
its conti'nuance, and' the· moment of its violation. The vigilance ,οἱ
his enemies was relaxed by the protestations of friendfliip‚ which>
concealed his hostile approach3 and Carthage was at length surprised‘
by the Vandals‚ five hundred and eighty—five years after thede-

. struffion of the city and republic by the' younger Scipio ³⁷:
