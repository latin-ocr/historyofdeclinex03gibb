THE DECLINE AND FALL

WVhen justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each

sonal safety. But in the loose society of the Germans, revenge was
always honourable, and often meritorious: the independent war-
rior chastised‚ or vindicated, with his own hand, the injuries which
he had offered, or received; and he had only to dread the resent-
ment of the sons, and kinfinen, of the enemy whom he had sacri-

ficed to his selfish or angry paffions.

was satisfied if he could persuade, or compel, the contending par-
ties to pay, and to accept, the moderate fine which had been

ascertained as the price of blood⁷². The fierce spirit of the Franks
would have opposed a more rigorous sentence ; 2 the same fierceness
despised these ineffecstual restraints: and, when their simple, manners
had been corrupted by the wealth of Gaul, the public peace was-
continually violated by asts of hasty or deliberate guilt. In every,v
just government‚ the same penalty is inilicied, or at least is imposed,

for the murder of a peasant, or a prinee. But the national inequality
established by the Franks, in their criminal proceedi'ngs, was the last

a constitution of Lothaire Ι. (Leg. Lango- by the MS. of Fulda, from whence Heroldus
bard, l. ii. tit. lvii.in Codex Lindebrog. p. published his edition. sce the four original

partial. From a various reading, in the
Salic law, (tit. xliv. not xlv.) the Abb6 de
Mably (tom. i. p. 290—293.) has con-
jectured, that, at first, a Barbarian only, and
afterwards any man (consequently a Roman),
might live according to the law ofthe Franks.

byobserving‚ that the strifter sense (Barba-
rum) is expreffed in the resormed copy of
Charlemagne; which is confirmed by the

interpretation (hominem) is authoristd only=

of murder was expiated by a pecuniary sa-

HeinecciuS, in his preface to the Elements
of Germanic Law9 favourably suggests,
that at Rome and Athens homicide was only
punissied with exile. It is true: but exile
was a capital punilhment for a citizen of Rome
or Athens.
