oF 'THE RoMAN EMPIRE.

age, the nominal government of Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain, and
*Britain3 and the troops, which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom,
were opposed, on one side, to the Caledonians, and on the other to
the Moors. The great and martial praefeeture of Illyricum was
divided between the two princes: the defence and poffeflion of the
provinces of Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, still belonged to
thewwestern empire; but the two large dioceses of Dacia and Ma-
cedonia, which Gratiam had entrusted to the valour of Theodotius,
were for ever united to the empire of the East. The boundary in
Europe was not very different from the line which now separates the
Germans and the Turk83 and the respective advantages of territory,
riches, populousness, and military strength, were fairly balanced and
compensated, in this final and permanent division of the Roman
empire. The hereditary sceptre of the sons of Theodosius appeared
to be the gift of nature, and of their father3 the generals ancl mi-
nisters had been accustomed to adore the majesty of the royal in-
fants; and the army and people were not admonished of their rights,
and of their power, by the dangerous example of a recent election.
The gradual discovery of the weakness of Arcadius and Honorius,
and the repeated calamities of their reign, were not sufficient to ob-

of Rome, who still reverenced the persons, or rather the name8‚
xof their sovereigns, beheld, with equal abhorrence, the rebels
who opposed, and the ministers who abused, the authority of the
throne.

Theodofius had tarnissied the glory of his reign by the elevation
of Rufinus; an odious favourite‚ who, in an age-of civil and reli-
gious fafition, has defensed, from every party, the imputation of
every crime. The strong impulse of ambition and avarice ¹ had
