air⁶⁷. But the Ioftiness of. these buildings, which osten consisted of
hasty work, and insufiicicnt materials, was the cause of frequent and
fatal accidents; aud it was repeatedly enneted by Augustus, as well
as by Nero, that the height of private edifices, within the walls of
Rome, should not exceed the measure of seventy seet from the
ground ⁶⁸. ΠΙ. Juvenal ⁶⁹ laments, as it should seem from his own
cxperience,¹ the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he adj-
drefl'es the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the
smoke of Rome,· since they might purchase, in the little towns of
Italy, a cheerful commodious dwelling, at the senne price which they
annually paid for a· dark and miser-able lodging. House-rent was·
therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous
expence, the ground, which they covered with pellaces and garden83
but the body of the Roman people was crowded into a narrow
space ; and the different floors, and apartments, of the same housea·

complaints ofJuvcnal ς, and we lcarn from-

legal authority, that, in the time of Augustus

181.), the ordinary rent of the several coena-
cula, or< apartments of. an infida, annually»
produced forty thousand sesterceS, between,
three and four hundrectpounds sterling (Pan-
dec't. l. xix. tit. ii. N‘'.'3o.); a sum which.
proves at once the large extent, and high
value, of those common buildings.
