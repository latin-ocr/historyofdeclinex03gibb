OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE,

It may be affirmed‚ with holder affurance, that the Huns depo-
pulated the provinces of the empire, by the number of Roman
subjei’ffi whom they led away into captivity. In the hands of a wise
legissator, such an industrious colony might have contributed to dif-
fuse, through the deserts of Scythia, the rudiments of the useful and
ornamental art33 but these captives, who had been taken in war,
were accidentally dispersed among the hez-ds, that obeyed the empire
of Attila. The estimate of their respeffive value was formed by the
simple judgment of unenlightened, and unprejudiced, Bar-basians.
Perhaps they might not understand the merit of a theologian,

Α profoundly skilled in the controverfies of the Trinity and the

Incar‘iiationz yet they respe&ed the ministers of every religion ;
and the affive zeal of the Christian miffionaries, without approaching
the person, or the palace, of the monarch‚ successfully laboured in
the propagation of the gospel ²⁷. The pastoral tribes, who were ig-
norant of the distinction of landed property, must have disregarded
‚the use, as well as the abuse, of civil jurisprudence; and the skill of
an eloquent lawyer could excite only their contempt, or their ab-
horrence ²⁸. The perpetual intercourse of the Huns and the Goths
had communicated the familiar knowledge of the two national dia-
leets 3 and the Barbari-ans were ambitious of converfing in Latin, the

Hungarians have imagined, that it was ap- Zingis, who treated the rival miffionaries
plicd, by a hex-mit of Gaul, to Attila, who with impartial favour.
