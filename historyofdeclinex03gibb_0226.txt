THE DECLINE AND FALL

‘⁶ luxury, their private banquets ; the choice of the guests is the
‘⁶ subject of anxious deliberation. The modest, the sober, and the
“ learned, are seldom preferred3 and the nomenclators, who are
“ commonly swayed by interested motives‚ have the addi-ess to in-
“ sert in the list of invitatione, the obscure names of the most worth-

“ the great, are those pa1·as1te8‚ who pranise the most useful of all

waited at the door. This indelicate custom
is very frequently mentioned in the epigrams
of Martial, and the satires of Juvenal. See
likewise Suetonius, in Claud. c. 21. in Neron.
c. 16. in Domitian. c. 4. 7. These baskets
of provisions were afterwards converted into
large pieces ofgold and filver coin, or plate‚

viii. 82. Buffon, Hist. Naturelle‚ tom. viii.

oeconomy (Varro, de Re Rustica, iii. 15·)·
The excessive demand of them for luxurious
tables‚ was increased by the foolissi prohibi-
tions of the Censors3 and it is reported, that
they are still esteemed in modern Rome, and
are frequently sent as presents by the Colonna
princes (See Brotier, the last editor of Pliny,
tom.ii. p. 458. apud Barbou, ¹779·)·
