OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

th‘e stege of Rome, establissied their quarters in Gaul, it was natural
t'o suppose that their inclinatione could be divided only between the
emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent assiance,
and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the
occafional purpose of acting the part of a mufician or a monarcln
Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to affign a cause,
or a date),' Adolphus connected himself with the usurper of Gau13
