oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

”was exposed to the arms and laws of the ferocious Barbarians, who
contemptuoussy insulted their poffeflions, their freedom, and their
safety. Their personal injuries were partial and irregular3 but the
great body of the Romans survived the revolution, and still preserved
ν the property, and privileges, of citizens. A large portion of their
'lands was &united for the¹ use of the Franks: but they enjoyed the

η remainder, exempt from tribute ¹¹²3 and the same irrefistible violence

which swept away the arts and manufaetures of Gaul, destroyed the
elaborate and expenfive system of Imperial despotism. The Provin-
cials must frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the Salie
or Ripuarian laws5 but their private life, in the important concern&
of marriage, testaments, or inherstance, was still regulated by the
Theodofian Code3 and a discontented Roman might freely aspire, or
descend, to the title and char-aeter of a Barbarian. The honours of

the state were acceffible to his ambition: the education and temper of
the Romans more peculiarly qualified them for the offices of civil
govemment3 and, as soon as emulation had rekindled their military

ardour, they were permitted to march in the rankS, or even at the

fh'ead, of the vietorious Germans. I shall not attempt to enumerate

is singular enough3 but if Gregory attached
any meaning to that obsolete word, the trea-
sures of Mummolus must have exceeded
100,0001. sterling.
