OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the emperor to extirpate, by his authority, the horrid custom which
had so long reslsted the voice of humanity and religion⁵⁷. The pa-
thetic representations of Prudentius were less effectual than the ge-
nerous boldness of Telemachus, an Asiatic monk, whose d'eath was
more useful to mankind than his life ⁵³. The Romans were provoked
by the interruption of their pleasures; and the rassi monk, who had
descended into the arena, to separate the gladiator-s, was overwhelmed
under a ihower of stones. But the madness of the people soon
subfided3 they respected the memory of Telemachus, who had de-
served the honours of martyrd0m3 and they submitted‚ without a
murmur, to the laws of Honorius, which abolissied for ever the
human sacrifices of the amphitheatre. The citizens, who adhered to
the manners of their ancestors, might perhaps insinuate, that the

Iast remains of a martial spirit were preserved in this school of for-

titude, which accustomed the Romans to the sight of blood, and

‘to the contempt of death: a vain and cruel prejudice, so nobly
confuted by the valour of ancient Greece, and of modern Eu-
rope ⁵⁹ !

The recent danger, to which the person of the emperor had been
exposed in the defenceless palace of Mirm, urged him to seek a re-
treat in some inacceflible fortress of Italy, where he might securely
remain, while the open country was covered by a deluge of Barba-
On the coast of the Hadriatic, about ten or twelve miles

from the most southern of the seven mouths of the Po, the Thessa-

rians.

⁵⁷ See the peroration of Prudentius (in
Symmach. l. ii. 1121—1131.), who had
doubtless read the eloquent inveffive of Lac-
taurins (Divin. Institut. 1. vi. c. πα). The
Christian apologists have ποῖ spared these
bloody gamm, which were introduced in the
religicus-festivals of paganism.

⁵¹³ Theonleret, l. v.c. 26. 1 wish to believe
the story of St. Telemachm. Yet no church
has been dedicated, no altar has been ereQed,

to the only monk who died a martyr in the
cause of brithanity.
