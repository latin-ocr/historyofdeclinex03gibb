“ any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest
‘⁶ of the human species. When they have called* for warm water,

‘⁴ wilful murder, the master will mildly observe, that he is a worth-

‘⁴ foreigner, perhaps of no-contemptible rank, is introduced to one
“ of the proud and* wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the
‘⁴ first audience, with such warm profeffi0ns‚ and such kind enqui-
“ ries, that he retires, enchanted with the affability of his illustrious
“ friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey
