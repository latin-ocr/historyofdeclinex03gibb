t--r—³ fully draws his arguments from the schools of rhetoric, rather than

from those of philosophy. Symmachus endeavours to seduce the
imagination of a young prince, by displaying the attributes of the
goddess of viCtory3 he insinuares, that the confiscation of the reve-
nueS, which were consecrated to the service of the gods, was a mea-

·sure unworthy of his liberal and disinterested character3 and he

maintains, that the Roman sacrifices would be deprived offiheir force·
and energy, if they were no longer celebrated at* the expence, as well²

as in the name, o⁰the republic. Even scepticism is made to supply

‘an apology for superstition. The great and incomprehensible steret

of the universe eludes the enquiry of man. Where reason cannot in-
struit, custom may be permitted' to guide3 and every nation seems
to consult the di&ates of prudenceq by a faithful attachment to those·
ntes, and opinions, which have received the sanfi‘tion of ages. If
those ages have been crowned w-ith glory and prosperity‚ if 'the de-
vout people has frequently obtained the bleffings which they have
solicited at the altars of the gods, it must appear still more advisa-hle
to persist in the same salutary praGdce3 and not to risk the unknown
perils that may attend any rassr innovations. The test of antiquity
and success was applied with singular advantage to the religion
of Numa ; and ROME herself, the caelestial genius that prefided
over the fates of the city, is introduced by the orator to plead
her own cause before the tribunal of the emperors. ‘⁶ Most excel-
