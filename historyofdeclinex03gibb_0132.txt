praefect still exercised an uncontrouled authority over the civil and
military government of the East: and his treasures, if he could resolve:
to use them, might be employed to procure proper instruments, for·
the execution of the blackest deiigns, that pride, ambition, and re-
venge, could suggest to a desperate statesman. The charadrer of'
Rufinus seemcd to'justify the accusations‚ that he conspired against
the person of his sovereign, to seat himself on the vacant throne3 and
that hc had secretly invited the Huns, and the Goths, to invade the>-
provinces of the empire, and to increase the public eonfufion. The

of a powerful benefactor. In the review of a period indifferently
supplied with authent-ic materials, we cannot refuse to illustrate the
annals of Honorius, from the investives, orrthe panegyrics, of a·
contemporary writer3 but as ClaudIan appears to have indulged the-
most ample privilege of a poet, and a courtier, some criticism will
