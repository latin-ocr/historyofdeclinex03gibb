louse ⁴⁶. After the departure of the Goths‚ and the separation of the CXIJOEAVP·
allied army, Attila was surprised at the vast silence that reigned over ι--Ψ-Ι
the plains os Chfflons: the suspicion of some hostile stratagem de-
tained him several days within the circle of his waggons ; and his
retreat beyond the Rhine confeffed the last vidior-y which was at-
chieved in the name of the 'Western empirc. Meroveus and his
Franks, observing a prudent distance, and magnifying the opinion
of their strength, by the numerous fires which they kindled every
night, continued to follow the rear of the Huns, till they reached
the confines of Thuringia. The Thuringians served in the army of
Attila: they traversed, both in their march and in their return, the
territories of the Franks3 and it was perhaps in this war that they-
exercised the *emeli-ties, which, aboutsour-score years¹ afterwards, were
revenged by the soniof Clovie. They maffacred their hostageS, as
well as theirv captives: two hundred young maidens were ¹tortured
with exquisite and unrelenting rage3 their bod-ies were torn asunder
Ι by wild horses, or their bones were crushed under the weight of
rolling waggons ;4 and their uiiburied limbs were abandoned on the
public reads, as xa prejr to dogs and vultures. Such were *those savage
Α ancestors, whose imaginary virtnes have sometimes excited the praise
