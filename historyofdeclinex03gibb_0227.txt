by the more familiar names of trimae, or
backganzmon, was a favour-ite amusement of
the gravest Romans; and old Mucius Scae-

very skilful player. It was called ludus duo-

name of Persic etymology) from Ireland to

The Saturnalia ofMacrobius, and the Epistles
of Jermn, afford satisfaetory proofs, that
Christian theology, and claffic literature,
were studioussy cultivated by several Romans,
of both sexes. and of the highest rank.
