the same spirit, the Armorican provinces (a name which compre-

Loire ¹⁷³) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring issand.
They expelled thc Roman magistrates, who acted under the autho-
rity of the usurpet· Constantine ; and a free government was esta-
blilhed among a people who had so long been subjeec to the arbitrary

will of a master. The independence of Britain and Armorica was
soon confirmed by Honorius himself, the lawful emperor of the
'West 3 and the letters, by which he committed to the new states the
care of their own safety, might be interpreted as an absolute and
perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty. This
interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event. After
the usurpers of Gaul had successively fallen, the maritime provinces
were restored to the empire. Yet their obedience was imperfe& and
precarious ε the vain, inconstant, rebellious dispofitton of the people‚ e
