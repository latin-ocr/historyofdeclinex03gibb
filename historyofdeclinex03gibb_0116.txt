THE DECLINE AND FALL

earth trembled, and an odour, such as that of paradise, was finelt‘‚,
which instantly cured the various diseases of seventy-three of the
assistants. The companions of Stcphen were left in their peaceful
refidence of Caphargamala: but the relies of the first martyr were
transported, in solemn proceffion, to a church construc'ted in their·
honour on Mount Sion 3 and the minute particles of those relies, a
drop of blood ⁷⁸, or the scrapings of a bone, were acknowkdged,v
in almost every' province of the Roman world, to possess a divine
and miraculous virtue. The grave and learned Augustin ⁷⁹, whose
understanding scarcely admits the excuse of credulity, has attested
the innumerable prodigies which were performed in Africa, by the
relies of St. Stephen; and this marvellous narrative is inserted in the

ι elaborate work of the City of God‚ which the bish-op of Hippo de·-

figned as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of Christianity-
Augustin solemnly declares, that he has seles-'ted those miracles only
which were publicly certified by the personS, who were either the
objects, or the spectatore, of the power of the martyr. Many pro-
digies were omitted, or forgotten; and Hippo had been less favour-
ably treated ‘than the other cities of the province. And yet the
bishop enumerates above severity miracles, of ' which three were re-
surreecions from the dead, in the space of two years, and within the.
limits of his own diocese ²⁰. If we enlarge our view to all the
dioceses, and all the saints, of the Christian world, it will not be-
