His demands were obeyed or cluded.

u-—v———t hc claimed the spoils of a vanquished city, some vases of gold}

which had been fraudently embezzled3 the civil and military
governors of Noricum were immediately dispatch'cd- to satisfy his
complaints⁷z and it is evident, from their conversation with NIaxi—

min and Priscus, *in the royal village, that the valour andprudence

of AEtius had not saved the VVestern Romans from the common ¹

ignominy of tribute. Yet his dexterous policy prolonged the ad-

vantages of a salutary peace3 and a numerous army of Huns and
Alani, whom he had attached to his person, was employed in the
defence of Gaul. Two colonies of these Barbarians were judicioussy
fixed in the territori& of Valence and Orleans ⁸: and their ειξὶίνε
cavalry secured the important passages of the Rhome and of the
Loire. These savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the

subjects than to the enemies of Rome. Their original settlemerrt
was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest3 and the pro-
vince through which they marched, was exposed to all the calami-

ties of an hostile invasion ⁹. Strangers to the emperor or the re-

⁷ The embass'y confisted of Count Romu-
lus; of Promotus, president of Noricum ; and
of Romanus, the military duke. They were
accompanied by TatulIuS, an il'lustrious citi-
zen of Ρειονίο, in the same province, and fa-
ther of Orestes, who had married the daughter
os Count Romulus. See Priscus, p. 57. 65.
Cassiodorius (Variar. i. 4.) mentions another
embaffy‚ which was executed by'his father
and Carpilio, the son of AEtins; and as At-
tila was no more, he could safely boast of
their manly intrepid behaviour in his pre-
sence.

in Historiens de France, tom. i. p. 639. A
few lines afterwards, Prosper observes, that
lands in the ulterior' Gaul were affigned to the
Alani. Without admitting the correction of

Dubos (tom. i.p. 300.) 3 the reasonable sup-

pofition of two colonies or garrisons os Alani,
will confirm his arguments, and remove his>
