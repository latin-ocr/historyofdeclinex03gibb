house‚·on his way to the palace3 and offered, according to the

,custom of 'the countrrs, ‘her respec‘tsul homage, by intreating him to

taste the-wine and meat, which >she had prepared for his reception.
ΑΒ soon as the monarch had gracioussy accepted her hospitable gift,
his domestics lifted a small filver table to a convenient height, as he
sat on horseback3 and Attila, when he had touched the goblet with
heis lips, again saluted the wife of Onegesius, and continued his

march. During his refidence at the scat of empne, his hours were ’

not wasted in the recluse idleness of a straglio3 and the king of the
Huns could maintain his superior dignity, without concealing his
person from the public view. He frequently ass'embled his council‚
and gave audience to the ambaffitdors of the nation33 and his people
mig‘ht appeal to the supreme tribunal, which he held at stated times,
and, according to the eastern custom, before the principal gate
of his wooden palace. The Romans, both of the East and of the
West‚ were twice invited to the banquets, where Attila feasted <with
the princes and nobles of Scythia. Maxiinin and his colleagues
were stopped on the thressiold, till they had made a devout libation
to the health and prosperity of the ‘king of the Huns, and were
conducted, after this ceremony, to their respective seats in a spacious
hall. The royal table and couch, covered with ⁴carpets and fine
linen, was raised by several steps >in the midst -of the hall ; andr -a ’
son, an uncle, or perhaps a favourite king, ·were admitted to {hare
the {imple and homely repast of Attila. Two lines of small tables,
each of which contai-ned threeor four guests, were ranged inor-der

on either hand,; the right was esteemed the most honourable, but .

the Romans ingenuoussy confess, that they were placed >on the
left3 and that Beric‚ an unknown chieftain‚ most probably of

rh'effiGothie racc, ,preceded ¹the *representatives ,οἱ 'Iheodofius -and
Valentiniani.
