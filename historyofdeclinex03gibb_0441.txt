OF THE ROMAN EMQIRE.

The Itali ans, 111110 had 110110 fince 1611011 nccd the 6 <ercisc of arms,
were surpriled, after forrt> years peace, by the apprzoich of a formi-
dable Barbarian, whom they abtim-‚red as the enemy of their reli-
gion, as well as of their republic. Amidst the general>consternation,
AEtius alone was incapable of fear 3 but it was impossible that he should
atchieve, alone, and unassisted, any military exploits worthy of his
former renown. The Barbarians who had defended Gaul, refused·
to march to the relief of Italy3 and the succours promised by the
Eastern emperor were distant and doubtful. Since AEfius, at the
head of his domestic troops, still maintained the field, and harass'ed
or retarded the march of Attila, he never shewed himself more truly
great, than at the time when his conclu& was blamed by an ignorant
and ungrateful people ⁵⁹. If the mind of Valentinian had been sus-
ceptible of any generous sentimehts, he would have chosen such a
general for his example and his guide. But the timid grandson of
Theodosius, instead of sharing the dangers, escaped from the sound
of war3 and his hasty r‘etieat from Ravenna to Rome, from an im-
pregnable fortress to an open capital, betrayed his secret intention of
abandoning Italy, 113 soon 113 1116 danger should approach his Imperial
person. This shameful abdication was suspended, however, by the
' spirit of doubt and delay, which commonly adheres to pufillanimous
counsels‚ and sometimes cori‘ec‘ts their pernicious tendency. The
VVestern emperor, with the senate and people of Rome, embraced
{he more salutary resolution of deprecating, by a solemn and (sup—
pliant embaffy, the wrath of ’ Attila„ This important commiffion
