286 v THE DECLINE AND FALL»

CXQQLP· emperor3 and the last 'year of the fourth century was polluted by

ι--ψ-ι the cozfitlfhip of an eunuch, and a ssave. This strange and inexpi-
able prodigy ⁸ awakened, however, the prejudices of the Romans.
The effeminate consul was rejected by the west, as an indelible stain
to the annals of the republic3 and, without invoking the shades of
Brutus and Camillus, the colleague of Eutropius, a learned and re-

speetable magistrate⁹‚ sufficiently represented the different maxims of

the two administrations.

ξιξ ζ’ῐῧῗέζὲζ The bold and vigorous mind of Rufinus seems to have been ac-

tuated by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit 3 but the avarice
of the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the praefeQm.
As long as he despoiled the oppreffors, who had enriched themselves
with tlie plunder of the people, Eutropius might gratify his covetous
disposition without much envy or injustice: but the progress of his*
rapine soon invaded the wealth which had been* acquired by
lawful inheritance‚ οι· laudable industry. The usual methods of
extortion were prae'tised and improved3 and Claudian has {ketch-
ed a lively and original pieture of the public audfion of the
state. “ The impotence of the eunuch” (says that agreeable satirist)
“ has served only to stimulate his avarice: the same hand which, in
“ his servile condition, was exercised in petty thefts, to unlock
γ “ the coffers of his master, now grasps* the riches of the world;
