THE DECLlNE AND FALL

C H A Ρ· the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Burgundians‚ might embrace the

XXX.

ι-Ὗ-μ resolution of abandoning to the fugitives of Sarmatia, their woods

and morasses3 or at least of discharging their superfluous numbers
on the provinces of the Roman empire⁶⁶. About four years after
the victorious Toulun had assumed the title of Khan of the Geougen,
another Barbarian, the haughty Rhodogast, or Radagaisus⁶⁷, marched
from the northern extremities of Germany almost to the gates of
Rome, and left the remains of his army to atchicve the destruction
of the West. The Vandals, the Suevi, and the Burgundians, formed
the strength of this mighty host ; but the Alani, who had found an.

hospitable reception in their new seats, added their active cavalry to-
the heavy infantry of the Germans3 and the Gothic adventurers
crowded so eagerly to the standard of Radagaisus, that, by some
historians he has been styled the King of the Goths. Twelve thou--
sand warriors, distinguished above the vulgar by their noble birth„
or their valiant deeds, glittered in the van ⁶³3 and the whole mul---
titude, which was not less than two hundred thousand fighting men, Α
might be increased, by the acceffion of women, of children, and of
ssaves, to the amount of four hundred thousand persons. This formi-
dable emigration, iffued from the same coast of the Baltic, which had
poured forth the myriads of the Cimbri and Teutones, to affault Rome
and Italy in the vigour of the republic. After the departure of
those Barbarians, their native country, which was marked by the
vestiges of their greatness, long ramparts, and gigantic moles⁶⁹, re·-

⁶⁶ Zosimus (l. v. p. 331.) uses the general
description of, the nations beyond the Da-
nube and the Rhine. Their situation, and
consequently their names, are manifestly
ffiewn, even in the various epithets which
each ancient writer may have casually add·

“1⁸⁶⁷ The name of Rhadagast was that of a

local deity of the Obotrites (in Mecklen-
burgh). A hero might naturally assume the
appellation of his tutelar god3 but it is not

probable that the Barbarians ffiould worship
an unsuccessful hero. See Mascou, Hist. of
the Germans, viii. 14⁸

⁶³ Olympiodorus (apud Phodum, p. 180.)
uses the Latin word, οπτιματοι ; which does '
not convey any precise idea. Ι suspect that-
they were the princes and nobles, with their
faithful companions ς the knights with their-2
'squires‚ as they would have been styled some
centuries afterwards.
