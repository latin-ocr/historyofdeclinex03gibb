under the banneis of Gern an, or Gallie, counts: their attack was
feeble and unsuccessfuh but the friendly and hostile provinces were
desolated with indiscriminatc ruge. The corn-fields‚ the villages,
the churches themselves, were consumed by fire; the inhabitants
were mfflhcred, or dragged into captiv'ity3 and, in the disorderly
retreat, five thousand of these inhurnan savages were destroyed by
hunger or intestine discord. When the pious Gontran reproached
the guilt, or negleet, of their leaders ; and threatessed to inflict, not
a legal sentence, but instant and arbitrary execution3 they accused
the universal and incurable corruption of the people. “ No one,'’
they said, “ any longer fears or respeecs his king, his duke, or his
“ count. Each man loves to do evil, and freely indulges his cri-
“ minal inclinations. T-he most gentle correc‘tion provokes an im·-
“ mediate tumult ; and the rash magistrate, who presumes to censure,
“ or restrain, his seditious subjects, seldom escapes alive from 'their
“ revenge ¹²¹.” It has been reserved for the same nation to expose,
by their intemperate vices, the'most odious abuse of freedom} and
to supply its loss by the spirit of honour and humanity‚ which now
alleviates and dignifies their obedience to an absolute sovereign.

Gallie poffeffion33 but their loss was amply compensated by the
easy conquest, and secure enjoyment, of the provinces of Spain.
From the monarchy of the Goths‚ which soon involved the Suevic
kingdom of Galicia, the modern Spaniards still derive some national
vanity: but the historian of the Roman Empire is neither invitess
