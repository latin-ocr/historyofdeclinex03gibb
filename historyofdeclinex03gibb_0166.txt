Stilicho iffued his orders to the most remote troops of the West, to
advance, by rapid marches, to the defence of Honorius and of Italy..
The fort1·esses of the Rhine were abandoned ; and the safety of Gaul·
was prometed only by the saith of the Germane, and the ancient
terror of the Roman nam-e. Even the legion, which had been sta-·
tioned to guard the wall of Britain against the Caledonians of the
North, was hastily recalled³⁶3 and a numerous body of the cavalry
of the Alani was persuaded to engage in the service of the emperor,
who anxioussy expeSoed the return of his general. The prudence
and vigour of Stilicho were conspicuous qn this occasion, which
revealed, at the same time, the weakness of the falling empire..
The legions of Rome, which had longsmce languisned in the
gradual decay of discipline and courage, were exterminated by the·
Gothic and civil wars3 and it was found iinpoflible, without ex*
hausting and exposing the provinces, to affemble an army for the

defence of Italy.
When Stilicho seemed to abandon his sovereign in the unguarded}

by the Goths. palace of Milan, he had probably calculated the term of his absence,

the distance of the enemy, and the obstacles 'that might retard theirv
march. He principally depended on the rivers of Italy, the Adige,
the Mincius, the Oglio, and the Addua3 which, in the winter or
spring, by the fall of rains, or by the melting of the snows, are,

commonly swellcd into broad and impetuous torrents³⁷. ¹ But the· x
