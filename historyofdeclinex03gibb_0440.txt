THE DECLINE AND FALL

t-q-—a nests on the bosom of the waves3 and though he allow& that the

Venetian provinces had formerly contained many noble families, he
insinuates‚ that they were now reduced by misfortune to the same
level of humble poverty. Fish was the common, and almost the
universal, food of every rank: their only treasure consisted in the
plenty of salt, which they extracted from the sea: and the exchange
of that commodity‚ so effential to human life, was substituted in the
neighbouring markets to the currency of gold and filver. A people‚
whose habitatione might be doubtfully affigned to the earth or water,
soon became alike familiar with the two elements 3 and the demands
of avarice succeeded to those of neceffity. The issanders, who, from
Grado to Chiona, were intimately connected with each other, pe-
nctiated into the heart of Italy, by the securefthough laborious,

nav igation of the rivels and inland canals. Their vessels, which were?

continually inci-eafing in fize and number, vifited all the harbours of
the Gulf3 and the marriage, which Venice annually celebrates with
the Hadriatic, was contracted in her early infancy. TheePistle of
Cassiodorius, the Praetorian praefect, is addressed to the maritime

tribunes: and he exhorts them, in a mild tone of authority, to ani- s

mate the zeal of their countrymen for the public service, which re-
quired their affistance to transport the magazines' of wine andloil
fi· om the ploxince of Istria to the rzoy tl city of Ravenna. The am-
biguous office of thele magistrates is explained by the tradition, th4at,

in the twclxe principal issande, twelve tribunes, or judges, were cie-
ιιι ed by an annual and popular election. The existence of the VC'.
netian republic under the Gothic kingdom of Italy, is attested by the
same authentic record, which annihilates their lofty claim of ori-'
gina] and perpetual independence ⁵⁸. ’
