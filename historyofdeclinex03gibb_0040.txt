(tom. i. orat. i. p. 33. epist. lv. p. 814.

are faintly marked by Tillemont‚ and fairly

in the several stages of this business. The
peroration of the last (tom. i. p. 528), in
which he takes a solemn leave of men and
angels, the city and the emperor, the East
and the West, Sec. is pathetic, and almost
sublime.
