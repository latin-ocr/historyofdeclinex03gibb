or THE RoMAN EMPI'RE.

Theodosius resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather,
and to seat his cousin Valentinian on the throne of the West. The
royal infant was distinguished at Constantinople by the title of Nobi-
lg'ffimus: he was promoted, before his departure from Thessalonica,
to the rank and dignity of Ccefizr ,- and‚ after the conquest of Italy,
the patrician Helion, by the authority of Theodosius, and in the
presence of the senate, saluted Valentinian the third by the name of
Augustus, and solemnly invested him with the diadem, and the Im-ss'
perial purple ⁵. By the agreement of the three females who governed
the Roman world, the son of Placidia was betrothed to Eudoxia,
the daughter of Theodofius and Athenais; and, as soon as the lover'

and his bride had attained the age of puberty, this honourable al-
liance was faithfully accomplished.' At the same time, as a compen·-
sation, perhaps, for the expences of the war, the Western Illyricum
was cletached from the Italian dominions‚ and yielded to the throne
of Constantinople ⁶. The emperor of the East acquired the useful

dominion of the rich and maritime province of Dalmatia, and the
dangerous sovereignty of Pannonia and Noricum, which had been
“filled and'ravaged above twenty years, by a promiscuous crowd of
Huns, Ostrogoths, Vandals, and Bczvarians, Theodofius and Va-
lentinian continued to respe& the obligations of their public and do-
mestic alliahce3 but the unity of the Roman government was finally
diffolved. By a positive declaration, the validity of all future laws
“was limited to the dominions of their peculiar author3 unless he
should think proper to communicate them, subscribed with his own
hand, for the approba-tion of his independent colleague ⁷.
