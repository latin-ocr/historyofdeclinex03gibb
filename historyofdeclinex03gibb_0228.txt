THE DECLINE AND FALL

“ is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspi*
‘⁶ cion of a contagious malady, is of sufficient weight to excuse the
“ visits of the most intimate friends ; and even the servants, who are
‘⁶ dispatched to make the decent enquiries, are not suffered to return
“ home, till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ab·
‘⁶ lution. Yet this selfiss1 and unmanly delicacy occafionally yields
“ to the more imperious paffion of avarice. The prospe& of gain
“ will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spolet03 every sen--
“ timent of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an in·-
“ heritance‚ or even of a legacy 3 and a wealthy, childless, citizen is
“ the most powerful of the Romans. The art of obtaining thot:v
“ fignature of a favourable testament, and sometimes of hastening
“ the moment of its execution, is perfeGdy understood ; and it has,
“ happened, that in the same house, though in different apartments,
‘⁶ a husband and a wife, with the laudable defign of over-reaching
⁴⁴ each other, have summoned their resped'tive lawyers, to declare, at
“ the same time, their mutual, but contradiCtory, intentions. The
“ distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury, often
‘⁶ reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedient&
“ When they desire to borrOW, they employ the base and suppli-
“ cating style of the ssave in the comedy ; but when they are called
“ upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the
“ grandsons of Hercules. lf the demand is repeated, they readily
‘⁶ procure some trusty sycophant, instruit& to maintain a charge of
‘⁶ poison, or magic, against the insolent credit0r3 who is seldom
“ released from prison, till he has figned a discharge of the whole·
“ debt. These vices, which degrade the moral character of the
“ Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition„ that disgraces
“ their understanding. They listen with confidence to> the, predic—⁷
“ tions of haruspices, who pretend to read, in the entrails of vic-
“ tims, the figns of future greatness and prosperity ,· and there are·
