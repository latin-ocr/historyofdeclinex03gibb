618 THE DECLINE AND FALL .

C H Α Ρ· In a century of perpetual, or at least implacable, war, much cou-

Britain, Yet if the mernory of its champions is almost buried in
oblivion, we need not repine3 since every age, however destitute of
seience or virtue, sufficiently abounds with aete of blood and military
renown. The tornb of Vorfimer, the son of Vorfflgern, was ereeted
on the margin of the ,sea-shore, as a landmark formidable to the
Saxons, whom he had thrice vanquilhed in the fields of Kent.

Ambrosius Aurelian was· descended from a noble family of Ro-

the last fatal aetion ¹³⁹, was crowned with splendid success. But every
Britilh name is effaced by the illustrious name of ARTHUR ¹⁴⁰, the·
hereditary prince of the Silures, in South W ales, and the eleetive·
king or general of th'e nation. According- to the most rational ac·
count, he defeated, in twelve succeffive battles‚ the Angles of the
North, and the Saxons of the VVest3 but the declining age of the
hero was embittered by popular ingratitude‚ and domestic missor-
tunes. The events of his life are less interesting, than the singular
revolutions of his fame. During a period of five hundred years
the tradition of his exploits was preserved, and rudely embellissoed, by

conjecture of our antiquarium, Ambrosius is

to allow the reality of the round table.
