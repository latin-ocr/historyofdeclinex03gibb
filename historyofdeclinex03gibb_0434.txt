h--w--d with honourible wounds, was discovered under a heap of the ssain:

his subjeets bewailed the death of their king and father3 but their

tears were mingled with songs and acclamations, and his funeral rites
were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy. The Goths‚

dashing their arms, elevated on a buckler his eldest son Toxifiuond,

king accepted the obligation of revenge, as :2¹ sacred portion of his

the fierce and Undaunted aspe& of their formidable antagonist3 and

*their historian has compared Attila to a lion encompaffed in his den,

and threatening his hunters with redoubled fury. The kings and
nadons, who might have deserted his standard in the hour of dis-

real truth‚ the dangers of absence and delay3 and persuaded Torifi-
mond to disappoint, by his speedy return, the ambitious defigns of
his brothers, who ‚might o'ccupy the throne and treasures of Thou-

louse.
