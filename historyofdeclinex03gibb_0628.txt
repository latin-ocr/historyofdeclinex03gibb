While the kingdoms of the Franks and Vifigoths were establissoed

in Gaul and Spain, the Saxons atchieved the conquest of Britain, the
third great diocese of the Praefeecure of the West. Since Britain was-
already separated from the Roman empire, Ι might, without re—
proach, decline a story, familiar to the most illiterate, and obscure to>
the most learned, of my readers. The Saxons, who excelled in the
use of the oar, or the battle-axe, were ignorant of the art which
could alone perpetuate the fame of their exploits: the Provincials‚
relapsmg into Barbarism, neglected to describe the ruin of their coun-
try3 and the doubtful tradition was almost extinguished, before the·
miffionaries of Rome restored the light of science and Christianity.
The declamations of Gildas, the fragments, or fables, of Nennius‚
the obscure hints of the Saxon laws and chronicles, and the ecclefia-
stical tales of the venerable Bede¹²⁶, have been illustrated by the*
diligence, and sometimes embellished by the fancy, of succeeding
writers, whose works I arn not ambitious either to censure, or to

BurgundianS, or even of the Lombards.
