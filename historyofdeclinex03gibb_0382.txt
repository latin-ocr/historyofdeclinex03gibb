empire 3 and a tri'ffing incident soon became the motive, or pretence‚.
of a *destructive war ¹⁸. Under the faith of the treaty of Margus, a·
free market was held on the northern side of the Danube, which was«
protected by a Roman fortress‚ surnamed Constantia. A troop of
Barbaria-ns violated the commercia] security: killed, or dispersed, th&
unsuspecting trader83 and levelled the fortress with the ground}⁵
The Huus justified this outrage as an a& of reprisal3 alleged, that
the bishop of Margus· had enteredv their territories‚. to discover and
steal a secret treasure of their kings3 and sternly demanded the guiltys
melate, the sacri'legious spoil, and the fugitive subjects, who had
escaped from the justice of Attila. The refusal of the Byzantine
court was the signal of war3 and the Maefians at first applauded the·
generous firmness of their sovereign. But they were· soon intimidated*
by the destrunion of Viminiacum and the· adjacent town53 and the·
people was persuaded to adopt the convenient maxim, that apri-*⁸
vate citizen, however innocent 01· respectable, may be justly sacri--
ficed to the safety of his country. The· bissiop of Margus, who
did not pofl'ess} the spirit of a martyr, resolved to prevent the designa]
which he suspeded. He boldly treated with the princes ofilssh'e
Huns; secured, by solemn oaths, his pardon and reward3 posted
a numerous detaehment of Bar-basians, in filent ambuffi, on the bank'si
