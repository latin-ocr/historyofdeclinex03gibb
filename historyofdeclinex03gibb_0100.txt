In this wide and various prospe& of devastation‚ the spectator
may distinguilh the ruins of the temple of Serapis, at Alexandria ³⁵.
Serapis does not appear to have been one of the native gods, or
monster-s, who sprung from the fruitful soil of superstitious Egypt ³⁶.
The first of the Ptolemies had been commanded, by a dream, to im-
port the mysterious stranger from the coast of Pontus, where he bad
been long adored by the inhabitants of Sinope ; but-his attributes and
his reign were so imperfeCfly understood, that it became a subjeet of'
dispute‚ whether he represented the bright orb of day, or the gloomy
monarch of the subterraneous regions ³⁷. The Egyptians, who were
'obstinately devoted to the religion of their fathers, refused to admit

submitted‚ without refistance, to the power of the god of* Pontus:
an honourable and domestic genealogy was provided3 and this for-
tunate usurpet was introduced into the throne and bed of Ofiris ³⁹,
the husband of Iris, and the celestial monarch of Egypt. Alexandria,

³⁵ Sophronius composed a recent and se-
parate history. (Jerom, in Script. Eccles.
tom. i. p. 303.), which has' furuished mate-
rials to Secrntcs (l. v. c. 16.), Theodoret
(l. v. c. 22.)‚ and Rufinus (l. ii. c, 22.).
Yet the last, who had been at Alexandria,
before, and after, the event, may deserve
the credit of an original witness.

³⁶ Gerard Voffius <Operm tom. v. p. 80.
& de idololatria, l. i. c. 29.) strives to sup-
port the strange notion of the Father53 that
the patriarch joseph was adorcd in Egypt,
aa the bull Apis, and the god Serapis.

Tacit. Hist. iv. 83. Th.— Greeks, who had

travelled into Egypt, were alike ignorant of ι

this new deity.

³³ Macrobius, Saturi-iai. l. 1. c. 7, Such

tranioii. ’

³⁹ At Rome, lfis and Serapis were united
in the same temple. The frecedeney which
the queen ass‘umed, may seem to betray her
une-qual alliance with the stranger of Pontus.
But the superiority of the female sex was esta-
blifhed in Egypt as a civil and religionis insti-
tution (Diodor. Sicul. tom. i. 1. i. p. 31.
edit. Wcss'eling)‚ and the same order is ob-
served in Plutarch's Trcatise o‘fIfis {md Ost-
νηὶ whom he identifies with Serapis.
