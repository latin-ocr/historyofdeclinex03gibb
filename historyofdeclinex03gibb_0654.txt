THE DEcmNE AND FALL'

freedom and military spirit3 and the servile provinces,¹ destitute of
life and motion, expected their safcty from the mercenary troops
and governors‚ who were directed by the orders of a distant court0
The happiness of an hundred millions depended on the persona}
merit of one, or two, men, perhaps children, whose minds were
corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power. The deepest
wounds were infli&ed on the empire during the minorities of the
sons and' grandsons of Theodosius 3 and, after those incapable
princes seemed to attain the age of manhood', they abandoned the
church to the bishops, the state to the eunuchs, and the provinces to
the Barbarians. Europe. is now divided into twelve powerful, though
unequal‚ kingdoms, three respectable commonwealths‚ and a variety
of smaller, though independent, states: the chances of royal and
ministerial talents are multiplied‚ at least, with the number of its
rulers; and a Julian, or Semiramis, may reign in the North, wh-ile
Arcadius and Honorius ssumber on the thrones of the ,house of
Bourbon. The abuses of tyranny are restrained by the mutual in.
fluence of fear and 1hame3 republics havebacquired order and sta-
bility3 monarehies have imbibed the principles of freedom, or, at
least, of moderation ;- and some sense of honour and justice is intro-
duced into the most defective constitutions by the general, manners of
the times. In peace, the progress of knowledge a-nd industry is ac-
celerated by the emulation of so many active rivals: in war, the
European forces are exercised by temperate and undecifive contests.
lfa savage conqueror should iffue from the deserts of Tartary, he
must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of R'u‘ffia, thes'nu-
merous armies of Germany, the gallant nobles of France, and the
intrepid freemen of Britain3 who, perhaps, might confederate for ·
their common defence. Should the victorious Barbarians carry
ssavery and desolation as far as the Atlantic ocean, ten thousand
vess‘els would transport beyond their pursuit the remains of civilised
