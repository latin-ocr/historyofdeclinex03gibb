OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE=.·

The name of the Alemanni has been absurdly derived from their
imaginat-y settlement on the banks of the Leman lake ²¹. That fortunate
distrietj from the lake to Avenche, and Mount Jura, was occupied by
the Burgundians ²². The northern parts of Helvetia had indeed been
subdued by the ferocious Alemanni, who destroyed with their own
hands the fruits of their conquest. A province, improved and adorned
by the arts of Rome, was again reduced to a savage wilderness ; and
some vestige of the stately Vindonissa may still be discovered in the
fertile and populous valley of the Aar ²³. From the source of the
Rhine, to its conflux With the Mein and the MoseHe, the formidable
swarms of the Alemanni commanded either fide of the river, by
the right of ancient poffeffion, or recent victory. They had spread
themselves into Gaul, over the modern provinces of Alsace and Lor-
raine ; and their bold invasion of the kingdom of Cologne summoned
the 'Salic prince to the defence of his Ripuarian allies. Clovis en-

twenty-four miles from Cologne3 and the two fiercest nations of
