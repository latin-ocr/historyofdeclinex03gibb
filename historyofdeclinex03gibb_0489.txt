QF THE ROMAN EMPI-REae·

‘who is invested with this garment, should be guilty of .lying.”
“ Nor ls it proper (replied Leo), that a prince should be compelled
“ to refign his own juclg> ment, and the public interest, to the will,-
“ of a subject ⁶⁹.'’ After this extraordinary scene, it was impossible
that the reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sin-v

cere ;ν or, at least, that it could be solid and permanent. An army of

Isaurians ⁷⁰ was secretly levied, and introduced into Constantinople3

and while-Leo undermined the authority, and prepared the disgrace,''

ofthe family of Aspar, his mild and cautious behaviour restrained
them from any rash and desperate attempts‚ which might have been
fatal to themselves, or their enemies. The measures of peace and war
were affe&ed-by.d1is internal revolution.. As long as Aspar degraded
the majesty of the throne, the secret correspondence of religion and
interest engaged him to favour the cause of Genserie. When Leo had
delivered himself from t-hat lgnominious servitude, ¹he listened to the

complaints of the Italians; resolved to extirpate the tyr-anny of the⁴

Vandals3 and declared his alliance with his colleague, Anthemius,
whom he. sOlemnly invested with the diadem and purple of the
west.. .
