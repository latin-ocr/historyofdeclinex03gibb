tin-one, than she indulged her own, and the public resentment‚ by
an a& of popular justice. without any legal trial, the eunuch Chry-5
-saphius was executed before the gates of the city3 and the immense
ric-lies which had been accumulated by the rapacious favourite,
served only to hasten and to justify his puniffiment⁵¹. Amidst the
general acclamations of the clergy and people, the empress did not
forget the prcjudice and disadvantage to which her sex was exposed3
and ssie wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the choice of a
colleague‚ who would always respe& the superior rank and virgin
chastity of his wife. She gave her hand to Marciam, a senator, about
sixty years of age, and the nominal husband of Pulcheria was so-
lemnly invested with the Imperial purple. The zeal which he dis·-
played for the orthodox creed, as it was established by the council of
Chalcedon, would alone have inspired the grateful eloquence of the
Catholics. But the behaviour of Marciam in a private life, and af-
terwards on the throne, may support a more rational belief, that he
was qualified t01rest0re and invigorate an empire, which had been
almost diffolved by the succeffive weakness of two hereditary mo-
narchs. He was born in Thrace, and educated to the profeflion of
arms3 but Marcian’s youth had been severely exercised by poverty
and missortune‚ smce his only resource, when he first arrived at
Constanfinople, confisted in two hundred pieces of gold, which he
had borrowed of a friend. He pafl'ed nineteen years in the domestic
and military service of Aspar, and his son Ardaburius; followed

those powerful generals to the Persian and African wars; andobtained, .
by their influence, the honourable rank of tribune and senator. His
