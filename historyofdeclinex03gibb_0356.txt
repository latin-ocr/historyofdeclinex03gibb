Rome; and a crowd bf naked savages russied from the woods and
vallies of Mount Atlas, to satiate* their revenge on the polished ty·
muts, who had injurioussy expelled them from the native sovereignty
of the land.

The persecution of the Donatists ¹⁷ was an event not less favourable
to the defigns of Genseric. Seventeen years before he lauded in Africa,

a public conference was held at Carthage,by the order of the magistrate.
The Catholics were satisfied‚that, after the invincible reasons which they
had alleged, the ohstinacy of the schismatics must be inexcusable and
voluntary3 and the emperor Honorius was persuaded to infli& the
1110st rigorous penalties on a faffmn, whi'ch had so long abused his
patience and clemency. Three hundred biihops¹³, with many thou-
sands of the inferior clergy‚ were torn from their churches, stripped
of their ecclefiastical posseffions, banished to the issands, and pro-
fcribed by the laws, if they presumed to conceal themselves in the
provinces of Africa. Their numerous congregatione, both in cities
andin the country, were deprived of the rights of citizens, and of
the exercise of religious worship. A regular scale of fines, from ten
to two hundred pounds of filver, was curioussy ascertained, accord-
ing to the distinetions of rank and fortune, to punish the crime of
affisting at a schifinatic conventicle3 and if the fine had been levied
five times, without subduing the obstinacy of the offender, his future
punilhment was referred to the discretion of the Imperial court ¹⁹.
