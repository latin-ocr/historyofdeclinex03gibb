with temper and decency, expreffed‚ in the most outrageous language‚
his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person, and
to his nation. The conference of Rimini was hastily interrupted3
and the praefe& Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compclled to

petual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic. This
rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negociation.
The ministers of Honorius were heard to declam, that, if they had

as he moved with his army along the Flaminian way, he succeffively
dispatched the bishops of the towns of Italy to reiterare his offers of

peace, and to conjure the emperor, that he would save the city and
