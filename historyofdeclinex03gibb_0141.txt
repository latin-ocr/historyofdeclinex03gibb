OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The prudent Stilicho, instead of perfisting to force the inclinations
of a prince, and peoplc, who rejeoed his government, wisely aban—
doned Arcadius to his unworthy favourites 3 and his relutfi‘tance to
involve the two empires in a civil war, displayed the moderation of a
minister, who had so often signalised his military spirit and, abilities.
But if Stilicho had any longer endured the revolt of Africa, he would
have betrayed the security of the capital, and the majesty of the
Western emperor, to the capricious insolence of a Moorish rebel.

without the danger of a civil war. During those twelve years, the
provinces of Africa groaned under the dominionof a tyrant, who
seemed to unite the unfeeling temper of a stranger, with the partial
resentments of domestic faction. The forms of law were often su-
