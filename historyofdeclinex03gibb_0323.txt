υηῖιιῖρεξὶίῃς confidence in his dcacon Serapion3 and scldom applied κων-κ.)
his speculative knowledge of human nature to the particular clia-
radstrs, either of his dependents, or of his equals. Conscious of thc
purity of his intentions, and perhaps of the superiority of his genius,
the archbissiop of Constantinople extended the jurisdic‘tion of the
Imperial city, that he might enlarge the sphere of his pastoral
labours3 and the conduCt which the prosarie imputed to an am·-
bitious motive‚ appeared to Chrysostom himself in the light of a
sacred and indispensable duty. In his visitation through the Asiane
provinces, he deposed thirteen bishops of Lydia and Phrygia3 and
indiscreetly declared, that a deep corruption of fimony and licen-
tiousness had infected the whole episcopal order ⁴⁶. If those bissiop‘o
were innocent, such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a
well-grounded discontent. If they were guilty, the 'numerous as-
sociates of their guilt would soon discover, that their own safety
depended on the ruin of the archbishop5 whom they studied to
represent as the tyrant of the Eastern church.

This eeclefiastical conspiracy was managed by Theophilus 4⁷, arch- ρῐιι-γΐοιὶοιη
biss1op of Alexandria, an affifive and ambitious prelate, who displayed ffypffligessffid
the fruits of rapine in monuments of ostentation. His national dis- §ginah-
like to the rising greatness of a city, which degraded him from the A. D. 403·
second, to the third, rank, in the Christian> world, was exasperated
by some personal disputes with Chrysostom himself ⁴⁸. By the pri-

vate invitation of the empress, Theophilus land-ed at Constantinople,
