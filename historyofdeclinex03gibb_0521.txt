ΘΕ THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

was almost extirpated¹⁴¹. The plebeians of Rome, who were fed
by the hand of their master, perished or disappeared, as soon as
his liberality was suppreffed3 the decline of the arts reduced the in-
dustrious mechanic to idleness and want ; and the senators, who might
support with patience* the ruin of their country, bewailed their pri-
vate loss of wealth and luxury. One-third of. those ample estates,
to which the rui'n of Italy is originally imputed ¹⁴⁴², was extorted'for
the use of the conquerors. Injuries were aggravatedby insults ; the
sense of aaual sufferings was embittered by the fear of more dread-
ful evils3 and as new lands were allotted to new swarms of Bar-
barians, each senator was apprehenfive lest the arbitrary surveyors
should approach his favourite villa, or his most profitable farm.
The least unfortunate were thos-q who submitted without a murmur
to the power which it was impoffible to reli-st. Since they defired
to live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared
their lives ἱ; and s1nce he was the absolute master of their fortunes‚
the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and volun-
tary gift 3³. The distress of Italy was mitigated by the prudence
and humanity of Odoaoer, who had bound himself, at the price of ’

his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent
Ι multitude. The kings of the Barbarians were frequently refisted,
deposed‚or murdered‚by their native subjedts 3 and the various bands
of Italian mercenaries‚ who affociated under the standard of an
*elective general, claimed a larger privilege of freedom and rapiiie.
