After the defeat of Eugenius, the merit, as well as the authority, Death of

Theodofius.

of Theodofius was cheerfully acknowledged by all the inhabitants of A· D· 395»

the Roman world. The experience of his past conduct encouraged
the most pleafing expectations of his future reign ; and the age of the
emperor, which did not exceed fifty years, seemed to extend the
prospe& of the public felicity. His death, only four months after his
victory, was confidered by the people as an unforeseen and fatal
event, which destroyed, in a moment, the hopes of the rising ge-
neration. But the indulgence of ease and luxury had secretly noui-ish·-
ed the principles of disease¹²². The strength of Theodosius was unable
to support the sudden and violent tranfition from the palace to the
camp3 and the increasing symptoms of a dropsy announced the
speedy diffolution of the emperor. The opinion, and perhaps the
interest, of the public had confirmed the division of the Eastern and
W‘estern empires 3 and the two royal youths, Arcadius and Hono-
rius, who had already obtained, from the tenderness of their father,
the title of Augustus, were destined to fill the thrones of Constantinople
and of Rome. Those princes were not permitted to share the danger

and glory of the civil war¹²'; but as soon as Theodofius had triumphed
over his unworthy rivals, he called his younger son, Honorius, to
enjoy the fruits of the victory, and to receive the seeptre of the West

¹²¹ The events of this civil war are guther-
ed from Ambrose(tom. ii. epist. lxii. p. 1022.),
Paulinus (in Vit. Ambros. c. 26—34.)‚ Au-
gustin (de Civitat. Dei, v. z6.)‚ orofius (l.
vii. c. 35.), Sozomen (l. vii. c. 24.)‚ Theo-
·doret (1. v. c. 24.), Zosimus (l. iv. p. 281,
282.)‚ Claudian (in iii Cons. Hon. 63—105.
in iv Cous. Hon. 70—117.)‚ and the Chro-

nieles publilhed by Scaliger.
⁸²² This disease, ascribed by Socrates (l. ν.
e. 26.) to the fatigues of war, is represented

- ver. 111.

by Philostorgius (1. xi. c. 2.) as the effe& of
ssoth and intemperance: for which Photius
calls him an impudent liar (Godefroy‚ Dissert-
P· 438-)-

¹²³ Zofimus supposes, that the boy Hono-
rius accompanied his father (1. iv. p. 280.).
Yet the, quanto flagrabant pectora voto, is all
that flattery would allow to a contemporary
poet; who clearly describes the emperor's
refusal, and the journey of Honorius, qfter
the viCtory (Claudian in iii Cous. 78—125.).
