OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE„ 555

’king was considered as the deliverance of Italy ⁵¹. Yet the people, C §KQ-P·
and even the clergy, incapable of forming any rational judgment of zae-v-a
the business of peace and war, presumed to arraign the policy of
Stilicho, who so often vanquished‚ so often surrmmded, and so often
difiniffed the implacable enemy of the republic. The first moment

' but in less than seven yearS, the Gothic conquerors of Rome might·
read, if they were able to read, the superb inscription of that monu—
