contemptuoussy cast away3 and some savage saints of both sexes
have been adnfired, whose naked bodies were only covered by their
long hair. They aspired to >reduce themselves to the rude and miser-
able state in which the human brute is scarcely distinguished above ²
his kindred animals: and a numerous se& of Anachorets derived their
name from their humble practice of grazing in the fields of Meso-

potamia with the common herd ⁶⁷. They often usurped the den os
