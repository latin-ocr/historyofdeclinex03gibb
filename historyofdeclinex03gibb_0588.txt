of his brothers, to poss'css the dependent principality of Geneva.
The Arian monareh was justly alarmed by the satisfaCtion, and the
hopeS, which seemed to animate his clergy and people, after the
conversim] of Clovis ; and Gundobald convened at Lyons an affem-
bly of his bishops, to reconcile, if it were poffible, their religious
and politieal discontents. A vain conferenee was agitated between
the two factions. The Arians upbraided the Catholics with the
worship of three Gods: the Catholics defended their cause by theo-
logical distinfflons3 and the usual arguments, objections, and re-
plies, were reverberated with obstinate clamour3 till the king re-
vealed his secret apprehensions, by an abrupt but decifive question,
which he addreffed to the orthodox biffiops. “ If you truly profess
“ the Christian religion, why do you not restrain the king of
“ the Franks ? He has declared war against me, and forms alliances
“ with my enemies for my destruction. A. sanguinary ancl covet-
‘⁶ ous mind is not the symptom of a fincere conversion: let him
“ ssiew his faith by his works.” ‘T he answer of Avitus, bishop of
Vienna, who spoke in the name of his brethren, [was delivered with,
the voice and countenance of an angel. ‘⁶ We are ignorant of the*
‘⁶ motives and intentions of the king of the Franks: but we are.
“ taught by scripture, that the kingdoms which abandon th'e ‘divine
“ law, are frequently subverted3 and that enemies will arise on ¹
“ every fide against those who have made God their enemy. Re-·- ²
‘⁵ turn, with thy people, to the law of God, and he will give peace(¹¹
‘⁶ and security to thy dominions.'' The king of Burgundy, who‘
was not prepared to accept the condition, which the Catholics con.-
fidered as effential to the treaty, delayed and dismiffed the ecclefiasti-
cal conference3 aster reproaching his bishops‚ that Clovis‚ their friend>
and proselyte‚ had privately tempted the allegiance of liis brother ³⁹.
