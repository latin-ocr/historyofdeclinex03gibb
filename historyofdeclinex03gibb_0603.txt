Barbarism, our calmet· refled‘tions will ascribe to the Romans the ¹-w--ae

superior advantages, not only of science and reason, but of humanity
and justice. Yet the laws of the Barbarians were adapted to their
wants and delires, their occupations and their capacity3 and they
all contributed to preserve the peace, and promote the improve-
ments, of the society, for whose use they were originally established.
The Merovingians, instead of imposmg an uniform rule of conduet
on their various subjeets‚ permitted each people, and each family,
os their empire, sreely to enjoy their domestic institutions⁶⁹5 nor
’ were the Romans exeluded from the common benefits of this legal
toleration ⁷⁰. The children embraced the law of their parents, the
wife that of her husband, the freedman that of his patron3 and, in
all causes, where the parties were of different nations, the plaintiff, or
accuser, was obliged to follow the tribunal of the defendant, who
may always plead a judicial presumption of right, or innoeence.
A more ample latitude was allowed, if every citizen, in the presence
of the judge, might declare the law under which he defired to
live, and the national society to which he chose to belong. Such
an indulgence would abolish the partial distinetions of vistory ; and
the Roman provincials might patiently acquiesce in the hardships of
their condition3 fince it depended on themselves to affume the pri-
vilege, if they dared to affert the charaeter, of free and warlike Bar-

barians ⁷¹,
‘When

fines, this indulgence in favour of the plaintiff
(tit. xxxi. in tom. iv. p. 24⁶.) ; and the same
⁷ toleration is understood, or expressed, in all
the Codes, except {hat of the Vifigoths of
Spain. Tanta diversitas legum (says Age-
hard, in the ninth century) quanta non folum
in regionibus, aut civitatibus, sedetiam in
multis domibus habetur. Nam plerumque
contingit ut fimul eant aut sedeant quinque
homines, et nullus eorum communem legem

foolishly proposes to introduce an uniformity -

of law, as well as of saith.

manis legibus praecipimus terminari. Such
are the words of a general constitution pro-
mulgated by Clotaire‚ the son of Clovis, and
sole monarch ol the Franks (in tom. iv. p.
1 16.), about the year ⁴560. ,
