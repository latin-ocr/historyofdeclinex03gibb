defence of their country; and the twenty—three legions which were ι--γ--ι

employed in the diflerent camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily,
and Spain, required about one hundred thousand men. But there
still remained an equal number in Rome, and the adjacent territory,
who were animated by the same intrepid courage3 and every citizen
was trained, from his earliest youth, in the discipline and exercises
of a soldier. Hannibal was astonissied by the constancy of the se-
“ nate, who, without raifing the siege of Capua, or recalling their
scattered forces, expeSoed his approach. He encamped on the banks
of the Anio, at the distance of three miles from the' city: and he
was soon informed, that the ground on which he had pitched his
tent, was sold for an adequate price at a public auction ; and that a
body of troops was dismiffed by an opposite road, to reinforce the
legion-s of Spain ¹⁰. He led his Africansto the gates of Rome, where
he found three armies in order of battle, prepared to receive him3
but Hannibal dreaded the event of a combat, from which he could
not hope to escape, unless he destroyed the last of his enemies ; and
his speedy retreat confeffed the invincible courage of the Romans.

From the time of ‘ohe Punic-war, the uninterrupted succeffion of Genealogy

of the sena-

senators had preserved the name and image of the republic3 and the tot-s.

⁹ ln the t'hree ctnfies which were made of
the Roman people, about the time of the
second Punic war, the numbers stand as fol-
lows (see Livy, Epitom. l. xx. Hist. l. xxvii.
36. xxix. 37.)‚ ²70-2¹3› 137,108‚ 21‡,<:00.
'rhe fall of the second, and the rise of the
third, appears so enormous, that several cri—
tics, notwithstanding the unanimity of the
MSS. have suspected some corruption of the
text of Livy. (See Drakenborch ad xxvii.
36. and Beaufort, Republique Romaine,
tom. i. p. 325.) They did not confider
that the second cmfizs was taken only at

=Cc2

Rome, and that the numbers were diminissi-
ed, not only by the death, but likewise by
the abstnce, of many soldiers. *In the third
sensim, Livy expressly affirms, tha't the legions
were mustered by the care of particular com-
miffaries. From the numbers on the list,
we must always dedu& one twelfth above
thwestore, and incapable of bearing arms.
See Population dela quoe, p. 72.

¹⁰ Livy considers> these two incidents as
the effeets only of chance and com-age. Ι
[ιιΓΡεξὶ that they were both managed by the
admirable policy of the senate.
