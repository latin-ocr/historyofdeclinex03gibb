'respectable courtier, whose abilities had been long exercised in civil
and military employments, accepted with reludhmce the trouble-
some, and, perhaps, dangerous commiffion‚ of reconciling the angry
spirit of the king of the Huns. ‘His friend, the historiari Priscus ⁴¹,
embraced the opportunity of observing the Barbarian hero in the
peaccful and domestic scenes of life: but the secret of the embaffy,
a* fatal and guilty secret, was entrusted only to the interpreter Vigi-
lius. The two'last ambaffadors of the Huns, Orestes, a noble sub-
je& of the Pannonian province, and Edecon‚ a valiant chieftain of
’ the tribe of t-he Scyrri, returned at the same time from Constanti-
nople to the royal camp. Their obscure names were afterwards il-
'lnstrated by the extraordinary fortune and the contrast of their sona:
Vthe two servants of Attilabecame the 'fathers of the last Roman em·-
peror of the west, and ef the first Bar-barian king of Italy.

-The ambafl'adors, -who were followed by a numerous train of men
and horses, made their first halt at Sardica, at the distance of 'three

hundred and fifty miles, or thirteen days journey, from Constanti-t

nople. As the remains of Sardica were still included within ·the
limits of the empire, it was incumbent on the Romans to exercise
the 'duties of 'hospitality. They provided, with the affillance of the
. ¹provincialsz, a sufficient number of sheep and oxen3 and invited the
Ι Huns to a splendid, or at ‘least a plentiful, supper. But the har-
mon}r of the entertainment was soon disturbed by mutual prejudice
