THE DECLINE AND FALL

the Euphrates to the Hadriatic, resounded with the preparations of
war both by land aud sea. The ikilful disposition of the forces of
the East seemed to multiply their numbers, and distraeted the atten—
tion of Maximus. He had reason to sear, that a chosen body of

troops, under the command of the intrepid Arbogastes, would dire& ·
their march along the banks of the Danube, and boldly penetrate
through the Rhaetian provinces into the centre of Gaul. A power· .-

ful fleet was equipped *in the harboursof Greece and Epirus, with
an apparent defigo, that as soon as the passage had been opened by
a naval vietory, V alentinian, and his mother, should land in Italy,
proceed, without delay, to Rome, and occupy the majestic seat of

religion and empire. In *the mean while, Theodosius himself advanced -
at the head of a brave and disciplined army, to encounter his un·- ·

worthy rival, who, after the fle-ge of AEmona, had fixed his camp
in the neighbourhood of Siscia, a·city of Pannonia, strongly forti-¹
fied by the broad and rapid stream of the Save.

The vetemus, who still remembered the long refistance, and suc·-
ceflive resources, of the tyrant Magnentius, might prepare themselves
for the labours of three bloodycampaigriS. But the contest with his
successor, who, like him, had 'ufiirped the throne of the West, was
easily decided in the term of two months ⁷⁶, and within the space of
two hundred miles.¹ The superior genius of the emperor of the
East might prevail over the feeble Maximus 3 who, in this important
crisis, shewed himself destitute of military ss<i11‚ or personal cou-
rage3 -but the abilities of Theodosius were seconded by the advantage
which he pofl'effed of a numerous and active cavalry. The Huns,

⁴the Alani, and, after their example, the Goths themselves, were

:formed into >squadrons of archers; who fought ¹-on horseback, and

teonfounded the steady valour οξ the Gauls and Germans, by the
