THE DECLINE AND FALL

It was not enough that Theodofius had suppressed the insolent
reign of Arianism, or that he had abundantly revenged the injuries
which the Catholies sustained from the zeal of Constantius and Va-
lens. The orthodox emperor confidered every heretic as a rebel
against the supreme powers of heaven, and of earth ; and each of
those powers might exercise their peculiar jurisdiffion over the soul
and body of the guilty. The decrees of the council of Constantinople
had* ascertained the true standard of the faith3 and the ecclefiastics,
who governed the conscience of Theodosms, suggested the most ef·-
feehlal methods of persecution. In the space of fifteen years, he
promulgated at least fifteen severe edietsagainst the heretice, ⁴⁸ ; more
especially against those who rejeQed the dodirine of the Trinity3
and, to deprive them of every hope of escape, he sternly euasted,
that if any laws, or rescripts, should be alleged in their favour, the
judges should confider them as the illegal produClions either of
fraud, or forgery. The pena] statutes were direcsted against the mi-
nister-s, the affemblies, and the persons, of the heretics; and the
pafiions of the legissator were expressed in the language of declama-
tion and invecfffive. Ι. The heretical teachers, who usurped the sacred
titles of Bishops‚ or PresbyterS, were not only excluded from the
privileges and einoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clei-gy,
but they were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confisca-
tion, if they presumed to preach the doetrine, or to praffise the
rites‚ of their accurstd sedis. A fine of ten pounds of gold (above
four hundred pounds Sterling) was imposed on every person who
should dare to confer, or receive, or promote, an heretical ordina-
tion: vand it was reasonably expected, that if the race of pastors could
be extinguished‚ their helpless flocks would be compeHed, by igno-

not hardened, or inflamed, by religious zeaL let? geeztgoe ἶνὲῗζάἕὲἓεὲἰὶἶ Ῑὲοἳζζὶῗέἃξ
