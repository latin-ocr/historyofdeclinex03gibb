:2¹28 THE DECLINE AND FALL

cx¹.if1<i1p' had reason to dread the first efleets of the resentment of Eutropius.

ΠΥ „a He had been guilty of the unpardonable elime of introducing that

'²³⁰⁸' -praise must be allowed to a powcrful -and ungrateful fa'vourite, who

was satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor. Abundantius was
stripped of his ample fortunes by an Imperial rescript, and banishe'd
to Pstyus, on the Euxine, the last frontier of the Roman world,
where he subfisted by the precarious mexey of the Barbmians, till he
could obtain, aftei the fall of Eutropius, a milder exile at Sidon' m
of Timafius- Phoenicia. The destruction of Timasius ¹³ required a more serious
and regular mode of attack. That great officer, the master-general

of the armies of Theodofius, had fignalised his valour by a deci-

sxve victory, which he obtained over the Goths of Theffaly ; but he
was too prone, after the example of his sovereign, to enjoy the
luxury of peace, and to abandon his confidence to wicked and de-
figning'fiatterers. Timafius had ‘despised the public clamour, by
promoting an infamous dependent to the command of a cohort3 and
he deserved to³feel the ingratitude of Bargus, who was secretly
instigated by the favourite to accuse his patron of a treasonable con- '⁴
spiracy. The general was arraigned before the tribunal of Arcadius ⁷
himself 3 and the principal eunuch stood by the fide of the throne,

to suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign. But as this ἶ
form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary, the farther ‘¹
